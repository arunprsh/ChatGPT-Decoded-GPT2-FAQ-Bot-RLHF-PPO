"i have a few symptoms like the stomachache, congestion, and diarrhea but no fever. is it possible i have the virus?","stomach troubles aren't a common symptom of the coronavirus, but a fever is a key symptom, so it's unlikely that you have it. however, if you have any questions, call ahead to your doctor and make an appointment."
social distancing & business operations during the covid-19 pandemic,"q. do you have best practices to share with retail food stores, restaurants, and food pick-up and delivery services that cover safe food handling, as well as employee health? - added april 16, 2020
fda is sharing information about best practices to operate retail food stores, restaurants, and associated pick-up and delivery services during the covid-19 pandemic to safeguard workers and consumers. the information in two convenient formats addresses key considerations for how foods offered at retail and restaurants can be safely handled and delivered to the public, as well as key best practices for employee health, cleaning and sanitizing, and personal protective equipment (ppe). see best practices for retail food stores, restaurants, and food pick-up/delivery services during the covid-19 pandemic.
q: how do i maintain social distancing in my animal food production/processing facility and food retail establishment where employees typically work within close distances? - updated 4/6/2020
to prevent spread of covid-19, cdc is recommending individuals employ social distancing or maintaining approximately 6 feet from others, when possible. in animal food production/processing facilities and retail food establishments, an evaluation should be made to identify and implement operational changes that increase employee separation. however, social distancing to the full 6 feet will not be possible in some animal food facilities.
the risk of an employee transmitting covid-19 to another is dependent on distance between employees, the duration of the exposure, and the effectiveness of employee hygiene practices and sanitation. when it’s impractical for employees in these settings to maintain social distancing, effective hygiene practices should be maintained to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. also, see should employees in animal food production and retail settings and delivery staff for home-based delivery services wear face coverings to prevent exposure to covid-19?
important: maintaining social distancing in the absence of effective hygiene practices may not prevent the spread of this virus. animal food facilities should be vigilant in their hygiene practices, including frequent and proper hand-washing and routine cleaning of surfaces that workers commonly touch or contact. 
because the intensity of the covid-19 outbreak may differ according to geographic location, coordination with state and local officials is strongly encouraged for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.  
sick employees should follow the cdc’s what to do if you are sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).
q: should employees, such as cashiers, baggers, and cleaning personnel in animal food production and retail settings (such as pet stores or farm supply stores) and delivery staff for home-based delivery services, wear face coverings to prevent exposure to covid-19? - updated 4/24/2020
on april 3, the cdc released an updated recommendation regarding the use of cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of covid-19.  cdc recommends the use of simple cloth face coverings as a voluntary public health measure in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). 
for workers on farms, and in food production, processing, and retail settings who do not typically wear masks as part of their jobs, consider the following if you choose to use a cloth face covering to slow the spread of covid-19:
maintain face coverings in accordance with parameters in fda’s model food code sections 4-801.11 clean linens and 4-802.11 specifications.
launder reusable face coverings before each daily use.
cdc also has additional information on the use of face coverings, including washing instructions and information on how to make homemade face covers.
note:  the cloth face coverings recommended by cdc are not surgical masks or n-95 respirators.  those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current cdc guidance.
in addition, fda has developed a fact sheet to provide helpful information to the human and animal food industries on the use of respirators, facemasks, and cloth face coverings in the food and agriculture sector during coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic (last updated 4/24/20).
q: what steps can i take to clean my animal food facility/equipment to prevent the spread of covid-19?
some steps that can be taken to clean a facility or equipment to prevent the spread of covid-19 include:
following current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) requirements for animal food safety to maintain clean surfaces.
while not universally required under the cgmps in the preventive controls for animal food (pcaf) regulation, consider sanitizing high-contact surfaces and equipment that workers may come into contact with.
see:  fsma final rule for preventive controls for animal food.
human food facilities are required to use epa-registered “sanitizer” products in their cleaning and sanitizing practices. cleaning and sanitizing agents used in animal food production must be safe and adequate under the conditions for use.  using the epa-registered sanitizers may be one means of helping ensure safety and adequacy.
in addition, there is a list of epa-registered “disinfectant” products for covid-19 on the disinfectants for use against sars-cov-2 list that have qualified under epa’s emerging viral pathogen program for use against sars-cov-2, the coronavirus that causes covid-19. 
important: check the product label guidelines for if and where these disinfectant products are safe and recommended for use in food manufacturing areas or food establishments. 
we encourage coordination with localexternal link disclaimer health officials for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.
animal food facilities may want to consider a more frequent cleaning schedule.
q: are workers in the animal food (including for livestock and pet animals) sector considered part of the essential critical infrastructure workforce?
yes, in a guidance last updated by department of homeland security on march 28, guidance on the essential critical infrastructure workforce: ensuring community and national resilience in covid-19 response, workers in the food and agriculture sector – agricultural production, food processing, distribution, retail and food service and allied industries – are named as essential critical infrastructure workers. promoting the ability of american workers within the food and agriculture industry to continue to work during periods of community restrictions, social distances, and closure orders, among others, is crucial to community continuity and community resilience.
q: where should i send questions if we are having problems moving animal food/ingredients or getting animal food/ingredients through areas that have curfews and restrictions because of the coronavirus?
if you are experiencing issues regarding your supply chain, delivery of goods, or business continuity, please contact the fema national business emergency operations center at nbeoc@fema.dhs.gov. this is a 24/7 operation and they can assist in directing your inquiry to the proper contact. 
q: will fda/epa approve off-label use of quaternary ammonium sanitizer at 200 ppm as a hand sanitizer for checkers and customers?  it is currently on the epa approved list for use in retail to sanitize food prep areas, dishes etc., and we would like to use it instead of gel hand sanitizer due to the lack of availability.
we are aware of temporary out-of-stock conditions of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.  several manufacturers of these products have indicated that they are working to replenish supplies.  in addition, the fda has issued guidance for the temporary compounding of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers by pharmacists in state-licensed pharmacies or federal facilities and registered outsourcing facilities.  see immediately in effect guidance for industry: policy for temporary compounding of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products during the public health emergency.  fda has also issued guidance for the temporary preparation of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products by firms during the public health emergency (covid-19).  see guidance for industry: temporary policy for preparation of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products during the public health emergency (covid-19).
hand sanitizers are not intended to replace handwashing in food production and retail settings.  instead, hand sanitizers may be used in addition to or in combination with proper handwashing.  cdc recommends that everyone wash their hands with plain soap and water. alcohol-based hand sanitizers may be used if plain soap and water are not available.
as an interim measure, we understand some food establishments have set up quaternary ammonium hand-dip stations and sprays at 200 ppm concentration. these products are intended for use on surfaces, and as such, may not be formulated for use on skin. fda is aware of adverse event reports from consumers using such products as a replacement for hand sanitizers and advises against using these products as replacements for hand sanitizers."
should i wear a respirator in public?,"most often, spread of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among close contacts (within 6 feet). recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of covid-19. cdc recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue. people who are sick should stay home and not go into crowded public places or visit people in hospitals. workers who are sick should follow cdc guidelines and stay home when they are sick."
set boundaries so caring for the person doesn’t overwhelm you.,"it’s very important to continue taking care of yourself if you’re helping someone with depression. you can’t be expected to provide round-the-clock care, and you’ll burn yourself out if you try. be honest and tell the person what you’re willing to do for them. on your own time, enjoy hobbies and distractions to support your own mental health. 

as a general rule, caring for the person shouldn’t interfere with your own life. if it is, then you should consider communicating and setting some boundaries.
you might be hesitant to tell a depressed person that they’re crossing a line to avoid upsetting them, but this is counterproductive. you’re not only sacrificing your own mental health, but the person might also notice that you’re silently resenting them and feel worse."

my loved one recently returned from another country and is not reporting any symptoms. what are the best practices to protect our family members who all live close together?,"some types of travel and activities are higher risk for exposure to covid-19 (see list below).  if your family member participated in higher risk activities or may have been exposed before or during their trip, they should take extra precautions to protect others for 14 days after arrival:

stay home as much as possible.


avoid being around people at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19.


consider getting tested for covid-19.

here are examples of activities and situations that can increase travel related risk of exposure to covid-19:

being in an area that is experiencing high levels of covid-19 spread. you can check the levels for places traveled, including countries, u.s.. states and territories, counties, and cities.
going to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party.
attending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade.
being in crowds – for example, in restaurants, bars, airports, bus and train stations, or movie theaters.

support a local restaurant if it's possible.,"during the coronavirus outbreak, a lot of businesses are suffering from reduced traffic. one way you can help is to order food from small businesses in your area that are still trying to operate during this time. 
even just a few orders a day could help ensure your favorite take-out spot is ready to return to full service once the coronavirus threat has passed."
get groceries and other necessary items for the sick person.,"since your sick family member can’t leave home, it’s up to you and other loved ones to get supplies for them. if you live with the sick family member, it’s best to get food, medical supplies, and other household items delivered to your home. if you don’t live with the family member, drop off the items at your sick family member’s home. 

some grocery stores will deliver your items to you. however, you may need to order them about a week in advance since demand for this service is so high right now.
you can also use a service like instacart, favor, or shipt."
"keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth",". you may come into contact with coronavirus on a surface, like a doorknob or countertop. when this happens, the germs can linger on your hands, so you can easily infect yourself if you touch your face with dirty hands. avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth in case the virus is on your skin. 
if you need to touch your face, wash your hands first so you’re less likely to infect yourself."
what are cytokine storms and what do they have to do with covid-19?,"a cytokine storm is an overreaction of the body's immune system. in some people with covid-19, the immune system releases immune messengers, called cytokines, into the bloodstream out of proportion to the threat or long after the virus is no longer a threat.when this happens, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, potentially causing significant harm. a cytokine storm triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response that may damage the liver, blood vessels, kidneys, and lungs, and increase formation of blood clots throughout the body. ultimately, the cytokine storm may cause more harm than the coronavirus itself.a simple blood test can help determine whether someone with covid-19 may be experiencing a cytokine storm. trials in countries around the world are investigating whether drugs that have been used to treat cytokine storms in people with other, non-covid conditions could be effective in people with covid-19."
i am experiencing supply chain issues related to covid-19. what can i do?,"the covid-19 outbreak has raised concerns about potential veterinary supply issues. the avma is working with partners to mitigate potential shortages and supply issues.

are annual shareholder meetings and board of directors' meetings required to be in-person?,no. the michigan banking code of 1999 (code) does not require bank shareholders to meet in person and permits shareholders to vote by proxy. the code specifically permits boards of directors to meet “by means of electronic communication devices that enable all participants in a meeting to communicate with each other.”
spend a few minutes thinking about positive things.,"you're probably being bombarded with negative information and news right now, which can make it hard to stay upbeat. when you start to feel depressed, make time in your day to focus on things that make you happy. this might mean that before bed you reflect on 2 or 3 things that made you happy during the day or you remember a kind exchange that you had with someone. 
consider keeping a daily gratitude journal. you can write a few lines every day about the things that you're grateful for, things that made you happy, and kind things that you did for others."
what happens if someone goes to a hospital and they’re told they will not receive a test even if they’re experiencing symptoms?,"your healthcare provider will determine if you need to be tested for covid-19 and might consult with your local health department if needed. if your healthcare provider has determined that you do not need to be tested for covid-19, you should follow your healthcare provider’s guidance regarding any necessary treatment or self-care."
ease up on your regular rules.,"having your children home from school can mean everyone ends up with a lot of extra time on their hands. this is a good time to relax your restrictions on how much screen time your kids can have each day, for instance—letting them get lost in their phones, tablets, or video games can be a great way to buy a few quiet hours during the day.

i’m having trouble importing gloves into the united states. what do i need to do?,"in order to avoid delays of legitimate shipments, review the importing covid-19 supplies and fda’s instructions to importersexternal link disclaimer for important information surrounding importing products, including gloves, to ensure that the proper documentation is submitted at the time of entry. the fda has been ready and available to engage with importers to minimize disruptions during the importing process. if you have any specific import questions, you may email covid19fdaimportinquiries@fda.hhs.gov."
use a medical or surgical mask if you're a healthcare worker.,"these masks have 3 layers of fabric and provide good facial coverage. though not as effective as a respirator, they still filter out enough particles to protect the wearer. these types of masks are recommended for healthcare workers who don't work directly with covid-19 patients. 
standard medical masks are available at pharmacies or medical supply stores. you could also look online."
should i be tested with an antibody (serology) test for covid-19?,"these tests tell you if you had a previous infection by looking for antibodies in the blood.  antibodies are proteins made by the immune system when a germ enters a person’s body. our immune system helps us fight off germs and diseases. the test uses a blood sample to look for antibodies made in response to sars-cov-2 rather than looking for the virus itself. it usually takes 1-3 weeks for the body to make antibodies in response to an infection. we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.
antibody tests have limited ability to diagnose covid-19 and should not be used alone to diagnose covid-19. results from these tests should also not be used to make decisions about staffing or the ability of an employee to return to work, the need for available personal protective equipment (ppe), or the need to discontinue preventive measures, like social distancing."
help! i’m frustrated with my partner.,"that makes sense. if you’re cohabitating, you could be in a tough spot. if you’re not, you’ve probably had to figure out ways to see each other — or not — that feel safe and nurturing for you and the people around you. 
or as eric spiegelman, a podcasting executive based in los angeles, tweeted in april, “my wife and i play this fun game during quarantine, it’s called ‘why are you doing it that way?’ and there are no winners.”
no matter who you are or how you are interacting, make sure you take care of yourself first. then, make a plan. if you are both working from home, when can you take time to care for each other and feel normal and romantic again? what rituals can you implement to separate day from night, roommates from lovers? you might just have to impose boundaries. 
if you were both at work before the pandemic, separately, during the day, you probably didn’t talk for 14 waking hours straight. build in time apart, as if you really were at the office, so seeing each other is a nice break at the end of the day, rather than a droning grind. 
“the traditional marriage vows are ‘for better or for worse,’” said jean fitzpatrick, a relationship therapist based in manhattan. “this is for worse. and so how do we navigate a time like this? our relationships will either grow as a result, or they will be harmed.”
but this time together might actually make you closer. so many parts of our lives have changed without our consent, and we may be feeling a kind of grief about it. some people may not want to complain to their partners about these bad feelings, but if you don’t honestly share these feelings, you two might feel a sense of disconnect. lean on each other right now. 
and, you can still do nice, intentional, romantic things. get dressed up. foot rubs. chocolate. you’ll be ok."
what care should be available during pregnancy and childbirth?,"all pregnant women, including those with confirmed or suspected covid-19 infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after childbirth. this includes antenatal, newborn, postnatal, intrapartum and mental health care.a safe and positive childbirth experience includes:being treated with respect and dignity;having a companion of choice present during delivery;clear communication by maternity staff;appropriate pain relief strategies:mobility in labour where possible, and birth position of choice.if covid-19 is suspected or confirmed, health workers should take all appropriate precautions to reduce risks of infection to themselves and others, including hand hygiene, and appropriate use of protective clothing like gloves, gown and medical mask."
file a claim for unemployment benefits if you can't work due to the outbreak.,"losing your job is stressful regardless of the situation, but it's even more difficult when whole cities are on lock-down and stores are closed. fortunately, the cares act both extends and expands unemployment benefits. if you can't work due to the outbreak, you are likely eligible for unemployment benefits, even if you are self-employed or a gig worker. 

to apply for benefits, contact your state's unemployment office. keep in mind that these offices are overrun at this time, so there may be delays processing your application.
the cares act entitles you to a total of 39 weeks of regular unemployment benefits — this is 13 more weeks than you would normally get. you can also get an additional $600 a week on top of your regular benefits from april 5, 2020, through july 31, 2020."
set the mood by playing some relaxing music.,"good music can help you unwind and take you on a mental or emotional journey.  listen to some tunes you love or create a playlist that evokes whatever place you’d most like to be right now. play it while you’re relaxing outdoors, unwinding in the bath, having dinner, or even just stretching out on your couch.

for example, you could make a playlist of hawaiian music to help you feel like you’re on an island vacation.
listening to nature sounds is also a great way to unwind and set a peaceful mood."
exercise outside or at home if you can’t wear a mask while doing it.,"you might find it hard to breathe during your workout if you’re wearing a mask. don’t keep your mask on if you’re having trouble breathing. however, consider going outdoors for your workout or doing it at home. this way, you won’t have to worry about the spread  of covid-19. 

if you’re a walker or runner, you might get your exercise outdoors.
if you enjoy group classes at your gym, try doing a video aerobic, dance, or kickboxing workout at home instead.
you may still be able to wear your mask during weight lifting sessions. if not, try lifting weights at home or doing bodyweight exercises."
how can we protect people seeking tuberculosis care during the covid-19 pandemic?,"in a context of widespread restriction of movement of the population in response to the pandemic and isolation of covid-19 patients, communication with the healthcare services should be maintained so that people with tuberculosis (tb), especially those most vulnerable, get essential services. this includes management of adverse drug reactions and co-morbidities, nutritional and mental health support, and restocking of the supplies of medicines. enough tb medicines will need to be dispensed to the patient or caregiver to last until the next visit. this will limit interruption or unnecessary visits to the clinic. mechanisms to deliver medicines at home and even to collect specimens for follow-up testing may become expedient. home-based tb treatment is bound to become more common. alternative arrangements to reduce clinic visits may involve limiting appointments to specific times to avoid exposure to other clinic attendees; using digital technologies to maintain treatment support. community health workers become more critical as treatment is more decentralized.more tb patients will probably start their treatment at home and therefore limiting the risk of household transmission of tb during the first few weeks is important. vulnerable populations who have poor access to healthcare should not get further marginalized during the pandemic."
what rules apply to sports and recreation activities?,"you must follow the rules listed in the mandatory directive for
        recreational and athletic activities and any rules issued by the state health officer. 
the following sports and recreation activities are not allowed at all: 

any close contact sport played with people who are not members of your household. close
        interactions with people from other households create too much risk of covid-19 transmission.  this means you
        can’t play close contact sports (those that involve either physical contact or physical proximity of 6 feet
            or less)—like football, rugby, basketball, baseball, cricket, soccer, boxing and martial arts, partner
        and team dance, water polo, hockey, lacrosse, and ultimate frisbee—with people who are not from your own
        household. 

you can still do things like catch and throw a football or shoot hoops with a friend, because those versions
            of the game do not require close contact. 
you can also play any other sport or game with people from other households that doesn’t involve close
            contact (like tennis, bowling, running, or archery). 

going to a pro sporting event as a spectator. professional sports teams can train in their
        facilities, or hold games without any spectators present if the local health officer approves their
        facility-specific protocols, but you cannot attend a pro sports event as a spectator because allowing crowds at
        such events presents far too high a risk of covid-19 transmission. 
indoor swimming pools. the order issued july 2 prohibits indoor activities that involve
        removing face coverings. this means that indoor swimming pools are closed. 
indoor gyms and fitness centers. indoor gyms and fitness centers may not operate, although they
        may conduct outdoor operations if they follow all the rules in the mandatory directive for gyms and fitness
        facilities. ​"
how long is the incubation and transmission period for covid-19?,"the “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. most estimates of the incubation period for covid-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days."
what if my apartment catches on fire and i can't leave due to being quarantined?,"you are not expected to sit inside a burning building. common emergencies won't cease just because everyone is trying to self-isolate to prevent spread of the virus. if your building catches on fire, leave the building as safely and quickly as you can. try to assemble in an area that isn't overcrowded and remind each other to keep a safe distance to prevent any potential for spreading the virus. the authorities will be responsible for safe, quarantine-style rehousing in the event your building becomes uninhabitable, so follow their instructions."
return to your normal schedule if your results are negative.,"check with your family members and roommates to see if they tested positive or negative. if your whole household is negative and you’re feeling healthy, you don’t need to worry about quarantining yourself. 
double-check with your employer to make sure you’re allowed to return to work, even if your results are negative."
​how does workers' compensation work in pennsylvania?,"​the workers' compensation system protects employees and employers. employees receive medical treatment and are compensated for lost wages associated with work-related injuries and disease, and employers provide for the cost of such coverage while being protected from direct lawsuits by employees."
how long can the coronavirus that causes covid-19 survive on surfaces?,"a recent study found that the covid-19 coronavirus can survive up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. the researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. but most often they will fall more quickly.there's a lot we still don't know, such as how different conditions, such as exposure to sunlight, heat, or cold, can affect these survival times.as we learn more, continue to follow the cdc's recommendations for cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects every day. these include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.if surfaces are dirty, first clean them using a detergent and water, then disinfect them. a list of products suitable for use against covid-19 is available here. this list has been pre-approved by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) for use during the covid-19 outbreak.in addition, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water after bringing in packages, or after trips to the grocery store or other places where you may have come into contact with infected surfaces."
share a tribute with family and friends by writing a public note.,"another way to pay your respects is to write a public letter in honor of the deceased. briefly mention how much you loved or cared about them and spend the rest of your letter talking about the person you lost. include how they touched your life, what they accomplished, and how much they’ll be missed. send it out to anyone that was close to the deceased or share it on social media so that friends and family can see it. 
a tribute may start, “we lost an incredible person this past week. jasmine was a teacher, mother, and valued member of the community. she touched so many of us and will not be forgotten.”"
"if animals already on study need to be euthanized because the institution has shut down, what type of documentation or reporting is expected of the iacuc?","euthanasia of animals should be a last resort and the circumstances for when it is necessary should be described in the institution’s disaster plan. it is an institutional decision involving the veterinarian and the institution’s leadership. careful planning and alternatives to consider include:

transferring animals to a holding protocol,
postponing unnecessary procedures or manipulations,
relocating animals to another facility, and
cryopreservation for certain species."
say five times more positive things than negative things.,"think about the standard conversations you have with your partner throughout the day. are you words kind and caring, or do they veer to the negative side? in general, try to make five positive comments for each negative comment throughout the day.  while you don't have to pretend things are okay when they're not, it's healthy for both you and your partner if you remember to look for the bright side. 

you don’t have to be complimenting or expressing affection constantly, but your words should be uplifting and positive overall.
for instance, you can say something like: “the grocery store was pretty packed today, but i was able to get some of the things i needed.”"
provide care to a family member or vulnerable person in another home.,"if you help out family members or friends, you might be worried that the shelter-in-place will keep you from visiting them. luckily, you’re still allowed to go to someone else’s home if you’re providing care to someone who’s considered vulnerable, like the elderly. just make sure you’re going directly there and then back home. 

during the coronavirus shelter-in-place, you can provide daily care and assistance to anyone who is elderly, has a disability, or has a health issue. additionally, you can go to someone else’s home to care for minor children.
for instance, it would be okay for you to go to your elderly grandmother’s home to give her medication or to babysit for your sister’s children in her home."
check in on your loved ones in the morning.,"consider chatting with people while you eat meals or at other downtime during the day. if they are also working remotely this should be easy to make happen. if you or your family gets the virus, that becomes the first priority."
can private schools file for a waiver?,"the cdph guidance provides that both public and private schools in counties on the county monitoring list may request a waiver to conduct in-person instruction in elementary schools for grades tk-6.  the private school-equivalent of a superintendent (in most cases, the head of school) may request a waiver from the local health officer to conduct in-person elementary school instruction, in consultation with labor (as applicable), parent, and community organizations.  local health officers, in turn, should review local community epidemiological data, consider other public health interventions, and consult with cdph when considering a waiver request."
does this order lift the governor’s stay at home order?,"yes, this order lifts the statewide stay at home order and moves the state to a safer at home recommendation. it is important to stay home if you are sick. while in public, people should wear a cloth face covering, practice social distancing by waiting 6 feet apart from others while in public and wash their hands or use hand sanitizer. high-risk individuals are urged to stay at home and travel only for absolutely essential purposes. the cdc defines high-risk individuals as:
people 65 years or older
people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions, including people who are immunocompromised or who have chronic lung disease, moderate-to-severe asthma, serious heart conditions, severe obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis or liver disease"
how does who gather information?,"who continues to review information provided by published studies, including those that and are available as “pre-prints” (non-peer-reviewed manuscripts that are uploaded to pre-print servers).  who also identifies critical questions that need to be answered to understand and improve our response to covid-19 and guides research efforts on these issues. who convenes regular teleconferences with global expert networks of different scientific disciplines to evaluate all available studies and determine how the available evidence, best practices and experience of frontline workers can be translated into guidance and advice."
will there be any flexibility for the three year complete review?,"no, protocols must be renewed prior to the three-year expiration date. iacucs should consider using the flexibilities described in our guide notice not-od-20-088. continuing review of previously approved ongoing animal activities may be conducted using designated member review. alternatively, full committee review may be conducted virtually using electronic meeting formats or teleconferences in accordance with olaw’s telecommunications guidance not-od-06-052."
how long do i need to isolate if i test positive for covid-19?,"if you have confirmed or suspected covid-19 and have symptoms, you can end home isolation when:

 
it’s been at least 24 hours with no fever without using fever-reducing medication and
your symptoms have improved, and
at least 10 days since symptoms first appeared.


if you test positive for covid-19, but have not had any symptoms, you can end home isolation when:
 
at least 10 days have passed since the date of your first positive covid-19 test, and
you have had no subsequent illness."
donate to a cause in honor of the person who passed.,"another way to show respect for the person you’ve lost is to donate some money to a cause they cared about. this could be animal rights, education, youth programs, or international relief. choose a charity with a cause they were invested in and send the organization some money in honor of the person that passed. 

you can do this for your own private grieving, or send the family of the deceased a letter about donating on behalf of the person they lost.
many charities will ask if the donation is in honor of someone and memorialize their name in literature or public records."
who should clean and disinfect community spaces?,regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (ppe) required for the chemicals used.
download a delivery app.,"visit the app store on your phone and search for the delivery app you want to try. click on “install” to download the app to your phone. when it’s ready, click “open” to go to the app. 

good options include instacart, shipt, and peapod. you might also use your grocery store’s app, such as walmart grocery delivery, kroger grocery pickup & delivery, or heb curbside & grocery delivery.
if you have amazon prime, try amazon prime now, which usually delivers in 2 hours. you can also get expedited 1-hour delivery for a fee of around $10.
some services, like shipt, have an annual or monthly membership fee. however, some services, like instacart, allow you to pay per delivery."
what is the treatment if someone gets sick?,"there is no specific treatment for novel coronavirus (covid-19).
  patients who are confirmed to have the disease will be cared for
  by health care professionals, working closely with san mateo
  county health."
what if my business performs services at many different sites?,"businesses that perform services at scattered sites (such as landscapers, dog walkers, or in-home cleaning companies)
    may submit one social distancing protocol for their whole operation and do not need to complete a new protocol for
    every place they provide services (for example, every home where a landscaper works). all scattered-site businesses
    must provide a copy of their protocol to the owner or operator of each place they perform services (in addition to
    providing the protocol to all workers).
if a scattered-site business has a facility (like a headquarters office or a maintenance yard), the social distancing
    protocol must list that facility address in the “street address” field at the top of the protocol form, and the
    signage required by the social distancing protocol must be posted at the facility. these businesses should not check
    the “no business facility” box at the top of the form (because they have a facility, even if some or most of their
    services take place elsewhere).
however, if a scattered-site business does not have a facility of any kind and workers work
    only from scattered sites, these businesses should not fill in the “street address” field at the
    top of the social distancing protocol form. instead, they should click the “no business facility” box. these
    businesses will not need to post any signage (because they do not have a facility in which to post it). they should
    still go through the form carefully and check any boxes that apply to their business.
if a business has multiple facilities, however, it must fill out a social distancing protocol form for each location."
can my child still get their free school meals with all of new jersey’s schools closed?,"school meals

"can i wash my hands with cold water? if not, why not?","yes, you can use cold water. hot water is more effective at killing this virus because it cannot survive heat. however, when washing hands, rubbing well is important as this removes the virus in the running water, and using soap will also help to kill the virus. follow the who suggestion to wash your hands for as long as it takes to sing happy birthday twice, making sure to rub well between the fingers, on the palms and outside of your hands. this will work whether the water is cold or hot."
what is the risk of getting covid-19 on an airplane?,"air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. however, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. this may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes covid-19.

can patients with suspected and confirmed ncov infection be cohorted in the same room?,"ideally, suspected and confirmed 2019-ncov acute respiratory disease patients should be isolated in single rooms. however, when this is not feasible (e.g., limited number of single rooms), cohorting is an acceptable option. some patients with suspected 2019-ncov infection may actually have other respiratory illnesses, hence they must be cohorted separately from patients with confirmed 2019-ncov infection. a minimum of 1-meter distance between beds should be maintained at all times."
when will the gyms/dnd fitness facilities open back up?,"we understand how important fitness options are for both the physical and mental health of our defence team members. the re-opening of dnd fitness facilities will be dependent on local/regional restrictions. many factors need to be considered, including but not limited to the public health conditions in your part of the country, so we recommend you consult with your local chain of command.

"the flu kills more people than covid-19, at least so far. why are we so worried about covid-19? shouldn't we be more focused on preventing deaths from the flu?","you're right to be concerned about the flu. fortunately, the same measures that help prevent the spread of the covid-19 virus — frequent and thorough handwashing, wearing a mask, not touching your face, coughing and sneezing into a tissue or your elbow, avoiding people who are sick, and staying away from people if you're sick — also help to protect against spread of the flu.if you do get sick with the flu, your doctor can prescribe an antiviral drug that can reduce the severity of your illness and shorten its duration. there are currently no antiviral drugs available to treat covid-19."
what is antibody testing for coronavirus (covid-19)?,"scientists have developed antibody tests for coronavirus
               (covid-19). testing a small blood sample lets doctors look for antibodies that
               a person's body may have made to fight the virus.
some of these tests work better than others. the virus that causes covid-19 is
               only one type of coronavirus — other types can cause colds.
               sometimes, the tests can't tell the difference between covid-19 and the other types
               of coronaviruses.
also, doctors don't know if having antibodies to coronavirus (covid-19) protects
               a person from being infected by the virus again. if there is protection, they don't
               yet know how long it might last.
talk to your doctor to see if antibody testing for coronavirus (covid-19) is right
               for you or your children."

try making homemade ricotta cheese for a fun afternoon project.,"add 1 tsp (6 g) of kosher salt to 1  qt (0.95 l) of sour milk, then heat the milk over medium-high until it starts to steam. add 3 us tbsp (44 ml) of lemon juice to the milk and let it sit for 5 minutes, during which time the milk will curdle. then, place a piece of cheesecloth in a strainer over a bowl. pour the cheese into the cheesecloth and let it strain until it's the consistency you're looking for.  

allow the cheese to drain for 45-60 minutes to make a softer ricotta, or 1-2 hours if you'd prefer a thicker cheese.
to make queso fresco, use white vinegar instead of lemon juice and double the salt. after you strain the curds, form them into a disc and press them with a weight until the cheese is ready."

take the following steps to cope with a disaster:

take care of your body– try to eat healthy well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, and get plenty of sleep. avoid alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.
connect with others– share your concerns and how you are feeling with a friend or family member. maintain healthy relationships, and build a strong support system.
take breaks– make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. try taking in deep breaths. try to do activities you usually enjoy.
stay informed– when you feel that you are missing information, you may become more stressed or nervous. watch, listen to, or read the news for updates from officials. always check your sources and turn to reliable sources of information like your local government authorities.
avoid too much exposure to news– take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories. it can be upsetting to hear about the crisis and see images repeatedly. try to do enjoyable activities and return to normal life as much as possible and check for updates between breaks.
seek help when needed– if distress impacts activities of your daily life for several days or weeks, talk to a clergy member, counselor, or doctor, or contact the samhsa (substance abuse and mental health services administration) helpline at 1-800-985-5990.

how could mexico's response to covid-19 impact public health on u.s. border communities?,"one of the lessons from this virus is that we are all connected. in china, they took extraordinary measures, ordering close to 800 million people to stay at home for a month and contact-tracing 700,000 people. but when they re-opened to international travel, they began getting 100-200 cases a day coming in from other parts of the world. to reduce transmission, we recommend a 14-day self-quarantine for travelers from regions where transmission levels are high, such as new york city.

               care.
other household members also should
               stay home. follow instructions from your doctor, local health care department,
               or the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) about who should stay home
               and for how long.

what is antibody testing?,"antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are proteins made by
               the immune system. their job is to recognize
               and get rid of germs. after they're made, antibodies
               usually stay in our bodies in case we have to fight the same germ again.
antibody testing lets doctors look for antibodies in blood.
               this sometimes can show if a person was infected by a virus or other germ in the past."
look for tenant advocacy groups in your area that can offer financial aid.,"advocacy groups typically have emergency funds to help tenants who can’t afford rent due to an emergency, so check if your state or city has one. reach out to the advocacy group and let them know about your situation to find out how they can help. if they have funds available, they may be able to provide some money so you’re able to afford your place for the next month. 
advocacy groups may also contact politicians or present to a city council to further protect your rights as a tenant."
are veterinarians and pet supply stores open for business?,"essential veterinary care, pet food retail, and animal shelter operations are all deemed essential services in delaware and therefore remain open to the public. it is recommended to call a facility prior to arrival for special instructions or changes to hours of operation."
can people in self-quarantine still have contact with their household members?,"you should keep apart from others, even in your household, as much as possible. stay away from others, even if you are not showing symptoms, because the virus can spread before symptoms appear. if you have no safe place to stay apart from others, king county can help. call the covid-19 call center at 206-477-3977. the line is open from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m."
what does it mean to be in quarantine?,"anyone who has close contact with a person with covid-19 will need to stay away from other people for at least 14 days to see whether symptoms develop. if you are a close contact of a person with covid-19, you should self-quarantine at home by staying in a separate room away from others. read caring for yourself at home and what to do if you are sick to learn more."
hang up immediately on robocalls.,"robocalls are always a common scam, but they’re being used to scare people during the covid-19 outbreak as well. almost all robocalls, which only play a recording rather than an actual person, are not legitimate or important. at best they’re spam, and at worst they’re phishing attempts to get your personal information. if you do receive a robocall, simply hang up without saying anything or pressing any buttons to keep yourself safe. 

some robocalls can record your voice or keypad presses. that’s why it’s best to simply hang up without doing anything else.
the government does not contact you with robocalls unless the message is purely information. they will never use a robocalls asking for money or information. 

if you receive a lot of robocalls, you can put yourself on the national do not call registry here: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0108-national-do-not-call-registry."
should i wear a mask to prevent catching coronavirus disease?,"you should wear a cloth face covering or mask whenever you are in a public setting, according to the thirteenth modification of the state of emergency declaration. this is to protect others from the risk of getting infected. public settings include grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, doctor’s offices, and public transportation. businesses and services can refuse entry to individuals who do not have a face covering. delawareans are urged to use cloth face coverings and reserve medical-grade masks for use by health care workers and first responders. delawareans wearing a face covering should practice strict hand-washing before and after touching the face covering, according to the delaware division of public health (dph).
face coverings are not a replacement for washing hands, practicing physical distancing, and staying home. delawareans who are sick should wear a face covering over their nose and mouth if they must be around other people – even while at home.
governor carney’s order does not require children aged 12 or younger to wear a face covering. any child 2-years-old or younger must not wear a face covering, due to the risk of suffocation.”
the use of face masks is also crucial for health workers and other people who are taking care of someone infected with covid-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility). read more about guidance for face coverings."
what are the requirements for face coverings at colleges and dorms?,"we are finalizing guidance for higher education institutions. face coverings will be required in common areas, including cafeterias except while eating. face coverings will not be required in closed dorm rooms."
"questions addressing the proper handling of healthcare personnel (hcp) who have clinically recovered from sars-cov-2 infection, but are still within 3 months of onset of their prior infection.","if hcp have a high-risk exposure within 3 months of their initial infection to a patient with sars-cov-2 infection, should they be restricted from work for 14 days after the exposure?
cdc has posted guidance addressing risk assessment and work exclusion for hcp with potential exposure to sars-cov-2. due to their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable individuals, this guidance recommends conservative management of occupationally exposed hcp.
review of currently available evidence suggests that most individuals do not become re-infected within 3 months of resolution of sars-cov-2 infection. re-infection has not been definitively identified to date. several studies have documented persistent detection of virus using pcr after recovery, some even with redevelopment or new symptoms. however, people who were newly symptomatic or tested positive for sars-cov-2 after recent resolution of an acute infection did not appear to be infectious to others. testing of asymptomatic individuals during this 3-month period is complicated by the fact that some people have detectable virus from their prior infection during this period; a positive test during this period may more likely result from a prior infection rather than a new infection that poses risk for transmission. in light of this, exposed hcp could continue to work, while monitoring for development of symptoms. if symptoms develop, exposed hcp should be assessed and potentially tested for sars-cov-2, if an alternate etiology is not identified. some facilities might still choose to institute work exclusion for hcp following a high-risk exposure.
2. if hcp within 3 months of their initial infection develop symptoms consistent with covid-19, should they be excluded from work and retested?
hcp within 3 months of a confirmed sars-cov-2 infection who develop symptoms consistent with covid-19 should be evaluated to identify potential alternative etiologies for their symptoms. if an alternate etiology for the symptoms cannot be identified, they may need to be retested for sars-cov-2 infection with the understanding that a positive viral test could represent residual viral particles from the previous infection, rather than new infection. decisions about the need for and duration of work exclusion should be based upon their suspected diagnosis (e.g., influenza, sars-cov-2 infection).
3. do hcp within 3 months of their initial infection need to wear all recommended personal protective equipment (ppe) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection? for example, if there are limited respirators, should respirators be prioritized for hcp who have not been previously infected?
regardless of suspected or confirmed immunity, healthcare personnel should always wear all recommended ppe when caring for patients. in situations of ppe shortages, facilities should refer to cdc strategies for optimizing ppe supply. however, as with other infectious diseases (e.g., measles), allocation of available ppe should not be based on whether hcp have been previously infected or have evidence of immunity.
4. should hcp within 3 months of their initial infection be preferentially assigned to care for patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection?
while individuals who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection might develop some protective immunity, the duration and extent of such immunity are not known. staffing decisions should be based on usual facility practices. any hcp assigned to care for patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection, regardless of history of infection, should follow all recommended infection prevention and control practices when providing care. guidance on mitigating staff shortages is also available."
cancel your event if you're not sure when to reschedule for.,"if you'd prefer to wait until you can be 100% certain that it's safe to have the wedding of your dreams, it might be best to cancel for now. then, once the coronavirus outbreak has been contained and/or we have a vaccine, you can choose a new date and start the planning process again. 
this can be a hard decision, but try to keep in mind that canceling your wedding doesn't necessarily mean you're no longer going to get married—it just means that you're no longer moving forward with the ceremony as you'd originally planned."
when can patients with confirmed covid-19 be discharged from the hospital?,"patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. meeting criteria for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions is not a prerequisite for discharge from a healthcare facility. isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital transmission-based precautions.
decisions to discontinue transmission-based precautions or in-home isolation should be made according to the following guidance:

for hospitalized persons, see discontinuation of transmission-based precautions and disposition of patients with sars-cov-2 infection in healthcare settings.
for non-hospitalized persons, see interim guidance for implementing home care of people not requiring hospitalization for covid-19 and discontinuation of isolation for persons with covid-19 not in healthcare settings."
consider having an at-home date once you know a potential partner well.,"in general, it’s best to hold off on in-home visits until the coronavirus threat passes. however, it’s possible that the pandemic could last for 18 months or longer, so you both may have too difficult a time waiting that long. so you may decide to invite the person you’re dating over for dinner or a fun activity once it's been a few weeks or months. when you’re both ready, enjoy dinner, a movie, or a game night at each other’s homes. 
it’s best to wait until you know you’re interested in building a relationship with a person before inviting them over."
"what are the enforcement powers in place if a person violates quarantine restrictions, and is there a number to report the violation?","if a person does not comply with voluntary quarantine, the vdh may issue a quarantine order that legally requires the person to comply with quarantine restrictions. law enforcement can become involved, if needed, to ensure compliance."
"​i'm scheduled for a consultative examination, but i'm concerned about the spread of covid-19 or that i might be violating the governor's stay-at-home order by attending. will my case be denied if i decide not to attend the exam?",​the social security administration has temporary cancelled all consultative examinations and has directed that no consultative examinations be scheduled or rescheduled until further notice.
are n95 respirators recommended for coronavirus disease patients?,"no, n95 respirators should be saved for healthcare professionals. if you have coronavirus or you are caring for someone who does, you can wear a cloth face covering and continue to practice social distancing and hand washing whenever you can. if you are a healthcare professional, you should couple your n95 respirator with a clear face shield when you’re working."
allot yourself a certain amount of time to watch the news.,"don’t leave the news on all day—with all the constant reports and updates, the news may be overwhelming to listen to constantly. instead, give yourself 20 or 30 minutes to watch a news report before turning the tv off altogether. 

for example, you can watch the news from 9:00 to 9:30 am, then give yourself a break for the rest of the day.
if you like having the tv on, leave a fun tv show or program running in the background."
is it safe to go on vacation?,"it depends on how careful you are. 
while some parts of the country have more cases of covid-19 than others, “i think even more important than where someone goes is what they do when they go there,” said dr. andrew thomas, chief clinical officer at ohio state university’s wexner medical center. 
“much like even when you’re at home, if you are essentially controlling your environment, not going out  into public places with large crowds, you’re wearing a face mask, you’re washing your hands, you can go on vacation safely,” he said. 
“i think certainly flying on planes is a little less safe than driving,” thomas said. “but it’s really what you do when you go there. if you’re going to bars and restaurants, not wearing a mask, going out with large crowds … you’re going to potentially come home with the virus.”"
look for an online donation page if you’d rather give money.,"even if the shelter isn’t accepting physical donations, they may still have options to support them financially. look on their website to see if there’s a link that says “donate” or something similar. give as much money as you’re comfortable with to show your support and help keep the animals safe."
"if i am licensed/certified in canada, can i practice in the state of new  york to assist in the covid-19 response efforts?","currently, pursuant to executive orders,  physicians, physician’s  assistants,  specialist assistants,  registered professional nurses, licensed practical nurses, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, licensed clinical social workers,  licensed master social workers or any substantially similar titles licensed  and in current good standing in any province or territory of canada do not need  to hold a nys license or registration to practice in the state of new york. all  other licensed professionals are  required to be licensed in the state of new york in order to practice."
help your children practice empathy towards people who are sick.,"remind your kids that there’s nothing wrong with being sick and that people who tested positive for covid-19 need a lot of love and support as they continue to get better. encourage your child to express concern and good wishes for all sick individuals, and not just people they know."
work your abdominals with crunches.,"crunches or sit-ups are the most common core workout. lay on your back and bend your knees so your feet are planted a few inches from your hips. place your hands behind your head and bend your hips to bring your nose towards your knees. 

doing crunches on top of an exercise ball is easier on your lower back and also isolates your core more. try using one of these for a different exercise.
also keep your core tight during other exercises. this supports your body better and also trains your abdominal muscles.
you can do core workouts every day if you aren't sore."
contact the doctor immediately if the symptoms worsen.,"many cases of covid-19 are mild, so you likely don’t need to worry. however, it’s possible for complications, like pneumonia, to develop. while your family member is recovering, monitor their symptoms so you can get help if they need it. call the doctor if you think they’re getting worse. 
if your family member appears to get worse instead of better, it’s time to call the doctor. they may be okay, but it’s best to be safe."
am i at risk for covid-19 from a package or products shipping from china?,"there is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged covid-19 and how it spreads. two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (mers-cov and sars-cov). the virus that causes covid-19 is more genetically related to sars-cov than mers-cov, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. while we don't know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as sars-cov and mers-cov, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. in general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. currently there is no evidence to support transmission of covid-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of covid-19 in the united states associated with imported goods. information will be provided on the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) website as it becomes available.

are there cities that have enacted a targeted testing strategy for communities of color?,"yes. salt lake city opened up some of their first testing facilities on the west side of the city, for example, with the intent of testing minority groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the effects of covid-19 in utah. houston has created a mobile testing unit to ensure testing capacity in neighborhoods with at-risk communities. buffalo city council, voted unanimously to establish a testing site on buffalo’s eastside, a predominantly african american community. las vegas has made a concerted effort to place two of their testing facilities in north las vegas and have completed an outreach effort in partnership with a community church to encourage testing.  (dr. jennifer nuzzo, 5/13/20)"
answer any questions your kids may have.,"children are pretty smart. even if they don’t seem old enough to comprehend what’s going on, they have probably noticed that something’s up. give them a chance to ask you any questions they might have, and try to answer them honestly but reassuringly. 
if they have questions about covid-19, you can explain it in a simple, non-scary way, like “there’s a virus going around that spreads pretty quickly. you can get it from your friends even if they don’t know they have it. to keep ourselves healthy, we have to stay inside and away from people for now. even though it sounds silly, the best way to make this virus go away is to stay home all day!”"
i am well and asymptomatic. should i use a mask?,"according to the who, for individuals without respiratory symptoms, a medical mask is not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons. however, masks might be worn in some countries according to local cultural habits. if masks are used, best practices should be followed on how to wear, remove, and dispose of them and on hand hygiene action after removal. for more information, visit the who guidance on use of masks in the community."
hang out with your friends virtually.,"not being able to see your friends during college is super tough, especially if you still need to socially distance yourself. try to hang out with your friends online through virtual meeting platforms to get some social interaction while staying safe. 
zoom and skype are both free virtual meeting platforms that can host multiple people."
how should i wash fruits and vegetables in the time of covid-19?,"wash fruit and vegetables the same way you would in any other circumstance. before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. then wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw."
"can i catch the virus from being in an enclosed space (i.e. bus, subway) in close proximity to someone who doesn’t have respiratory symptoms?","since the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the risk of catching it from somebody who is asymptomatic, even a contact of a confirmed covid-19 case, is low. however, in light of the pandemic, everyone should maintain social distancing, which means keeping at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding mass gatherings and areas with large numbers of people, and practicing frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing according to the recommendation."
"are people allowed to go to drive-in movie theaters, drive-in religious services, drive-through graduations,
        or other vehicle-based activities if everyone stays inside their own car or truck?","yes.  according to the state’s stay home q&a page, “the state
    public health officer does not
    consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from
    individuals who are not part of their households.”  as long as everyone occupying the same vehicle is from the
    same household and people do not get out of their cars, pass objects through other people’s car windows, or
    otherwise physically interact, these activities are allowed.  note that drive-in movie theaters must follow all
    applicable rules in the state’s covid-19 industry guidance for
        family entertainment centers​."
i feel sick. what are the symptoms of covid-19?,"the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. other symptoms reported with covid-19 include chills, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. symptoms appear 2–14 days after exposure.
if you are generally in good health and get sick, you should stay home and manage your symptoms. call your doctor only if symptoms get worse.
if you are in a high-risk category, call your doctor as soon as you get sick and get their advice before you go anywhere."
q. what does it mean that covid-19 is a global pandemic?,"a pandemic is a global outbreak of disease.  pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people.  because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide. the virus that causes covid-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person.  cases have been detected in most countries worldwide, including the united states, which has recorded cases in all 50 states."
what protection measures should people take when using disinfectants?,"it is important to reduce your risk when using disinfectants:the disinfectant and its concentration should be carefully selected to avoid damaging surfaces and to avoid or minimize toxic effects on household members (or users of public spaces).avoid combining disinfectants, such as bleach and ammonia, since mixtures can cause respiratory irritation and release potentially fatal gases.keep children, pets and other people away during the application of the product until it is dry and there is no odour. open windows and use fans to ventilate. step away from odours if they become too strong. disinfectant solutions should always be prepared in well-ventilated areas.wash your hands after using any disinfectant, including surface wipes. keep lids tightly closed when not in use. spills and accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open. do not allow children to use disinfectant wipes. keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the reach of children and pets. throw away disposable items like gloves and masks if they are used during cleaning. do not clean and re-use.do not use disinfectant wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes.the minimum recommended personal protective equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof aprons and closed shoes. eye protection and medical masks may also be needed to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing.note: where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource limitations, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching the face should be the primary prevention approaches to reduce any potential transmission associated with surface contamination."
go to groups or clubs that involve your hobbies.,"if you can’t interact with people during your work day, you can do it after work instead. look around for local groups in your area to see if any of your hobbies or recreational activities line up with existing clubs or groups. 

try checking out the facebook page for your city or town to find like-minded people near you.
running groups, hiking groups, and adult sports teams are great ways to stay active outside of work."
do current diagnostic assays for routine human coronaviruses cross-react with sars-cov-2?,"no. multi-pathogen molecular assays, such as those manufactured by biofire or genmark, can detect a number of human respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness, but they do not detect the sars-cov-2 virus, which causes covid-19.
however, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) granted emergency use authorization (eua) for the cdc influenza sars-cov-2 (flu sc2) multiplex assay on july 2, 2020. test kits are in production and will be shipped to public health laboratories once production, including quality control and assembly, has been completed. the cdc influenza sars-cov-2 (flu sc2) multiplex assay is a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) test that detects and differentiates rna from sars-cov-2, influenza a virus, and influenza b virus in upper or lower respiratory specimens. the assay provides a sensitive, nucleic-acid-based diagnostic tool for evaluation of specimens from patients in the acute phase of infection."
can children be cared for at home if they have covid-19?,"children should be kept together with their parents or caregivers wherever possible. children with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a covid-19 patient, if they are not obese, do not smoke, and do not have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or immunosuppression.caregivers of children with covid-19 should monitor for signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration requiring urgent re-evaluation. these include difficulty breathing/fast or shallow breathing (for infants: grunting, inability to breastfeed), blue lips or face, chest pain or pressure, new confusion, inability to awaken/not interacting when awake, inability to drink or keep down any liquids. if caregivers are suspected or have confirmed covid-19 infection, medical and non-medical factors must be taken into account due to the negative and possible long-term consequences of even a short period of family separation.community protection focal points and caseworkers should help families plan–in advance–agreements for the care of children in case the caregiver becomes ill.  children living with primary caregivers who are elderly, disabled or have underlying health conditions should be prioritized."
wash or sanitize your hands afterwards.,"even if you did not touch any buttons, it may still be a good idea to clean your hands.  that way, anything you did accidentally touch will likely not pose a threat to your health and safety.
consider doing this after using the stairs or escalators as well."
make homemade toys if you want to do something crafty.,"even if you don’t have money to spend on new pet supplies, you may be able to reuse old materials as pet toys. for example, you can tie strips of fleece through the holes of a rubber sink mat to make a snuffle mat for dogs and cats to sniff around in. you can also sew small fleece pillows with some catnip inside to keep cats entertained. 
if you don’t have time to make toys, you can also buy them from a pet store or online."
"our institution has closed the lab for all but maintenance activities at this time. while we understand that charges for salaries, animal care, and other expenses may be allowable during this closure, will additional funds (e.g. from administrative supplements) be made available to support the lost time?","nih understands the effect of closures on the progress of nih-funded research. recipients affected by covid-19 should contact the funding ic to discuss the progress on the specific award and identify potential solutions.while institutes and centers plan, based on availability of funding, to issue administrative supplements when absolutely necessary, it is clear that for the vast majority of grantees, supplement requests in the next 2-3 months would be premature. we therefore recommend that institutions hold off on submitting covid19-related administrative supplement requests until such time as (1) the full impacts of the pandemic on your research are clear, and (2) you have had the chance to discuss the various options with the relevant nih staff and you have agreed that an administrative supplement is the best option for your project.there are two exceptions. the exceptions to this recommendation are for (1) supplements to existing projects that will allow investigators to immediately address scientific questions of direct relevance to the covid19 epidemic, and (2) supplements that are needed to address immediate, mission critical needs over the next 3 months. investigators who believe they meet these exceptions should raise these issues with their program officers or grants management specialists prior to submitting such requests."
what are the lab protocols for identifying the virus in food? on surfaces?,"as food has not been implicated in the transmission of covid-19, testing of food or food surfaces for this virus is not recommended. frequent cleaning of food contact surfaces with virucidal disinfectants such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (naclo) or products based on ethanol (at least 70%) should be carried out. alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like sars-cov-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (quats)."
how do i know when it is safe for patients to discontinue home isolation?,"as of july 20, persons with covid-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions:
at least 10 days* have passed since symptom onset and 
at least 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and 
other symptoms have improved

a limited number of persons with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days, that may warrant extending duration of isolation for up to 20 days after symptom onset. consider consultation with infection control experts.
read the full cdc guidance. there is separate guidance for immunocompromised patients."
"can concerts, spectator sports or other entertainment events take place in phase 2?","entertainment and professional sports events at large venues may take place so they can be broadcast to the public, but spectators are subject to the mass gathering limit. professional entertainers, athletes, coaches, performers, support staff and broadcast staff will not count toward the mass gathering limit. employees and other workers at facilities where entertainment events occur also will not count toward the mass gathering limit. venue operators allowing such events must follow specific public health requirements."
when will caf travel restrictions be eased to match provincial/regional restrictions? what are the domestic and international travel restrictions that apply to the defence team for both duty and travel?,"domestic travel matching what is permitted in a member's respective province or territory has been authorized since 15 may 20, with the exception of personnel assigned under op laser. domestic travel outside of a member's local area must be authorized through the leave pass procedure.  please refer to para 6.a.(26)(a)xi. of frag order 007 to cds tasking order 001 – op laser 20-10 for more information on accepted travel as well as restrictions for personnel assigned under op laser."
create a single team to manage operations through the crisis.,"during any crisis situation, communication is of the utmost importance to ensure that everyone in your business is on the same page. if you have a relatively small business, your team may simply consist of people who already managed operations. for larger businesses, keep the team to 5 to 7 people. 
arrange for the team to meet regularly and keep their operations transparent for the rest of the organization. using google docs or a similar program will help the team share information easily."
how can i cope with all the panic buying and not being able to get items i need because the stores are half empty?,"stores will restock their shelves, so just be patient and keep trying until you get what you need. it can help to go to stores early in the day, especially if they restock overnight."
do you have to have a fever to have covid-19?,"while a fever is a common symptom of having a covid-19 infection, this isn't always the case. research on those who have had the virus in china show that people experienced a fever in 88% of cases, leaving 12% of those with the infection not experiencing a fever. (information sourced from: professor sanjaya senanayake, the conversation, march 20, 2020)"
are children more at-risk?,"information about covid-19 in children is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that children with confirmed covid-19 generally had mild symptoms. person-to-person spread from or to children, as among adults, is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.  recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of covid-19.
however, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. despite lower risk of serious illness, children with covid-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with older adults and people of any age who may be at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19."
can we reuse gloves during covid-19?,"the fda generally does not recommend reuse of gloves. the fda recognizes that there may be availability concerns with gloves during the covid-19 public health emergency, but there are strategies to conserve gloves."
"a co-worker tested positive for covid-19, should i be concerned?","if you have been in close contact with your co-worker: you should self-quarantine away from others for 14 days since the last day you had contact with that person. your employer should contact you with further instructions. it is possible that your local health department will call you to discuss your risk, you can also reach out to your local health department. if you develop symptoms of respiratory illness, and are concerned about your health, please call your healthcare provider.
if you have not been in close contact with your co-worker: you should monitor yourself for symptoms of respiratory illness and remember to practice good social distance, but quarantine is not required. you should follow any instructions from your employer carefully. if you develop any symptoms, you should self-isolate at home and contact a healthcare provider if you are concerned about your health. remember to follow appropriate precautions for cleaning your work area, hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette.
expanded testing is also available across the state. now, most people are eligible to be tested for covid-19, even if they don’t have symptoms. look for a testing site using the testing site look up tool or call the covid-19 hotline at 888-535-6136 for help finding a site near you. 
tests may be ordered by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse for anyone and for any reason. some testing locations offer screening and testing without a doctor’s order.

"can bats in united states get the virus that causes covid-19, and can they spread it back to people?","other coronaviruses have been found in north american bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes covid-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the united states, including bats. in general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make north american species of bats sick. bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the united states. bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading covid-19. however, there is no evidence that bats in the united states are a source of the virus that causes covid-19 for people. further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by covid-19."
"i have been feeling ill since friday with sore throat, coughing, temperature and exhaustion. i am worried as i met friends last weekend who had returned from venice.","if you believe you have been in contact with someone who has travelled from a high-affected area, it's important to notify your health authorities and to quarantine yourself for 14 days. while a sore throat isn't a common sign of covid-19, a fever and dry coughing is."
what signs should cause people to seek medical attention?,"if you or your child develop a fever or cough, or have trouble breathing, seek medical attention immediately. if you suspect it is covid-19, call the doctor or emergency department before your visit, so the facility can help ensure that you don’t expose anyone else to the virus, if you have it."
my teenagers aren’t taking this seriously. any advice?,"coronavirus isn’t just infecting young people. it’s killing young, healthy people as well. 
we’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus.
dimitri mitchell, 18, admits he had a “false sense of security.” but he was later hospitalized with coronavirus and now wants everyone to take it seriously. 
“i just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. and it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” the iowa teen said. 
he started feeling sick with just a small cough. “i thought at first it was just a normal cold. and then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. 
“four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. i started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. i was getting warmer and warmer, and i was super fatigued. … i would start experiencing the worst headaches i’ve ever felt in my life. they were absolutely horrible.”
eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. his mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” 
mitchell is now recovering, but has suffered from long-term effects. 
“i just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “it’s a real problem, and i want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits. and just listen to all the rules and precautions and stay up to date with the news and make sure they’re informed.”"
what if you child doesn't like healthy food?,"try showing them the impression that you like it.  if the child has any older siblings, you can get that sibling to show the child that he/she also likes the food.  one more thing you could do is make a smoothie out of the vegetables. you could also add a sweetener to healthy food or you could give the child a reward if he/she eats the food, such as candy or stickers."
get basic pet supplies if the shelter doesn’t provide them for you.,"while many shelters will provide supplies for foster care, you may need to buy some of your own if they don’t have enough. get food and water bowls, a bed, food, a carrier, treats, and some toys to help the animal feel more comfortable in your home. if you aren’t sure what supplies you need, talk to the shelter since they can give you recommendations. 

call your local pet store to see if they’re open. otherwise, you may need to order the products online.
if you’re getting a dog, then get a collar, leash, and grooming brushes.
if you’re taking care of a cat, you will also need a litter box and cat litter.
you may need cages, bedding, or food pellets if you’re taking care of smaller animals, like rabbits or guinea pigs."
what should i do if a person who is incarcerated in my facility may have covid-19?,"if you think someone who is incarcerated in the facility is sick with covid-19 (see covid-19 symptoms), activate your emergency plan and notify local public health officials. ensure that the sick person is wearing a clean, disposable facemaskpdf icon, and separate the sick person from others, ideally within an individual housing space and bathroom. provide them with tissues for when they cough or sneeze, and a lined trash receptacle when possible.
staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected covid-19 cases should follow the cdc interim clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (covid-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. facilities without on-site healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department to coordinate effective isolation and necessary medical care. ensure only trained personnel wearing recommended personal protective equipment (ppe) have contact with or transport individuals who have or may have covid-19.
people who are incarcerated and have covid-19 should be placed under medical isolation in a separate room, ideally with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. if not available, refer to the full guidance document for other options for medical isolation. if multiple people become ill with covid-19:

make every effort to house each ill person individually, with their own bathroom. refer to the full guidance document for additional options if individual spaces are not available.
prioritize those at high risk for complications of covid-19 (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) for individual spaces that are available.

to prevent further spread:

use options for virtual court appearances, if possible.
suspend group gatherings.
limit non-medical transfers of people within and between facilities. ensure that anyone transferred out is screened for symptoms and contact with a covid-19 case before leaving the facility.
ensure that release planning includes screening for covid-19 symptoms and contact with a case. coordinate with local public health officials if releasing a symptomatic person to the community.
use multiple social distancing strategies.
handle laundry and food items of possible or confirmed cases of covid-19 with recommended ppe.
suspend visitation or offer non-contact visitation only.
consider quarantining all new entrants for 14 days before they enter the facility. (make sure that new entrants under quarantine are housed separately from other incarcerated people already under quarantine due to contact with a covid-19 case.)
if releasing someone to a community facility (e.g., a homeless shelter), contact the facility’s staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare to continue medical isolation, and coordinate with local public health officials.

provide clear information to staff and people who are incarcerated about the presence of covid-19 cases within the facility. close contacts of the sick person (who have been within 6 feet of the sick person or had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or sneeze) should be placed under quarantine for at least 14 days. follow cdc guidance on quarantining close contacts of people with covid-19.
if separate spaces for individual quarantined people are not available, refer to the full guidance document for other options. monitor symptoms twice per day and move anyone developing symptoms to medical isolation right away (after ensuring they are wearing a face mask). quarantined people at high risk for complications of covid-19 (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) should not be housed with other quarantined people if at all possible."

is there a difference between a mask and a respirator?,"masks and respirators both cover a wearer’s nose and mouth, but they differ in several aspects.masks are loose fitting and may not provide full protection from breathing in airborne pathogens, such as viruses.face masks (non-surgical masks), may not provide protection from fluids or may not filter particles, needed to protect against pathogens, such as viruses. they are not for surgical use and are not considered personal protective equipment., , surgical masks, are fluid-resistant, disposable, and loose-fitting devices that create a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and the immediate environment. they are for use in surgical settings and do not provide full protection from inhalation of airborne pathogens, such as viruses., respirators are personal protective equipment that tightly fit the face and filter airborne particles to protect health care workers. they provide a higher level of protection against viruses and bacteria when properly fit-tested. this document does not address respirators.this cdc infographic explains the differences between surgical masks and n95 respirators."
can you get covid-19 by living with an asymptomatic carrier?,"studies show that asymptomatic carriers can spread the virus to different items in a room, which may lead to other household members getting sick after touching something contaminated.  if someone you live with has covid-19, wash your hands frequently and try to keep a distance from them whenever possible. additionally, disinfect any common surfaces as often as possible, like furniture, countertops, or tables."
"what should i do with my stock of n95 respirators that have
  passed their manufacturer designated expiration date?","do not discard unused, expired n95 respirators. instead, contact
  your infection control or health & safety office. per cdc, in
  times of shortage, consideration can be made to use n95
  respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated expiration date.
  see details here: 
  strategies for optimizing the supply of n95 respirators and
  
  release of stockpiled n95 filtering facepiece respirators beyond
  the manufacturer-designated shelf life: considerations for the

stick to your daily routine as much as possible.,"even if schools are closed, you should still try to help your children keep a normal schedule. wake them up each day at the same time they would normally get up for school, and have them keep their same bedtime. that will make it much easier for them to readjust when school is back in session. 
in addition, try to stay calm and positive so you don't transfer any anxiety to your children, even if you're concerned about the reason that schools are canceled."
"as it is now, i sit within four feet of my neighbour and we can see the tops of each other's heads while sitting. if either of us stand, we have full view of each other. this is almost no different than being in a classroom environment.","we are doing everything possible to ensure that our defence team members are returning to a safe environment and these discussions will take place before anyone returns to their place of work. if maintaining a 2 metre physical distance is impossible, masks are to be worn by all implicated employees. in addition, all communal and personal surfaces must be routinely disinfected.
please speak to your local coc or manager to understand how to obtain nmm in your location."
are kids with special health needs more at risk from covid-19?,"few kids have been found to have the illness. so it's hard for experts to yet know
               how covid-19 might affect kids with ongoing health problems. to stay safe and avoid
               infection, follow the advice from the
               centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and other health experts. be
               sure to:

keep 6 feet apart from people you don't live with (called physical or social
               distancing).
wear a face covering or mask when out
               and not able to distance from others.
wash hands well and often."
can i be forced to work remotely if i want to work on-site?,"throughout all phases of business resumption, there will be a need for all managers to discuss with their employees their preferences for remote work and/or return to the workplace, map employee availability against operational requirements, and determine the feasibility from an infrastructure and a health and safety perspective. l1s are preparing business resumption plans which will be shared with staff as they are finalized.  activities will be prioritized and reintroduced in phases. please wait until you receive the all clear from senior management before physically reporting, to ensure your safety and the safety of others.  direction will be provided."
i need to provide my child’s school with documentation from our healthcare provider in order for my child to return to school for the 2020-2021 school year. should i take my child to their healthcare provider during this time of covid-19?,"the virginia department of health is encouraging students and their families to prepare for the upcoming school year.  many students will need updated immunizations, physicals for enrollment, medication administration, documentation for health conditions and emergency action plans for chronic conditions (asthma, allergy, diabetes and seizures). please contact your health care provider to discuss your child’s medical needs for the upcoming school year."
what safety measures are being implemented to protect personnel during partial resumption of training?,"we continuously review the practices and procedures necessary to conduct training in a safe manner and cflrs is in constant communication with our chain of command, military health services experts, and regional civilian health authorities concerning the prevention of covid-19 when training resumes. some of the preventative measures include, but are not limited to;

ongoing health monitoring of all personnel;
rigorous practicing of public health measures including physical distancing and proper hygiene techniques.
the issuance of non-medical masks to all members of the defence team for use when the maintenance of physical distancing protocols are not possible;
ensuring all staff, instructors and students are trained on and practice the response plan to an outbreak within cflrs or the surrounding community;
training will, initially, resume at a reduced capacity to ensure that all involved remain safe and healthy. capacity will increase if and only when local conditions permit this; and;
training and students will be contained within military facilities and locations until such time as the local situation permits otherwise."
can i have the flu and coronavirus at the same time?,"yes. testing positive for either the flu or coronavirus doesn’t exempt you from having the other at the same time. 
the flu and coronavirus share some common symptoms, such as fever and cough.
but many coronavirus patients suffer from shortness of breath, and some people with coronavirus lose their senses of taste or smell. but it’s important to note many people with coronavirus — possibly up to 50% — have no symptoms at all.
learn more about the differences between flu, coronavirus and allergy symptoms here."
what are the symptoms?,"fever, dry cough and difficulty breathing are hallmarks of coronavirus. 
symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks after exposure, the cdc says. but some people get no symptoms at all and can infect others without knowing it.
the illness varies in its severity. and while many people can recover at home just fine, some people — including young, previously healthy adults — are suffering long-term symptoms."
what are some things i can do to protect myself when grocery shopping?,"the alabama department of public health recommends the following: make a list before you go, only send one person to the store, wipe down the shopping cart, wear a cloth face covering, use hand sanitizer, and leave space between you and the other shoppers. do not shop if you are sick. choose online ordering if it is available. you can find these tips and more on our smart shopping flyer, available in english and spanish."
some people have said that avoiding alcoholic beverages is recommended to prevent a covid-19 infection. why is that?,"drinking a lot of alcohol regularly might lower the immune system's effectiveness and increase the chances of being infected. the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health says that: ""a glass of wine seems fine, but repeated rounds—especially of hard liquor—or increased alcohol use over days or weeks might suppress immune responses or lead to a greater susceptibility to pneumonia."" therefore, it seems that drinking a small amount of alcohol occasionally is okay but don't overdo it or increase how much you'd normally enjoy. this includes avoiding binge drinking, which is known to impair the immune system, leaving the drinker more susceptible to infections. (information sourced from: globalhealthnow.org, a johns hopkins publication)."
i saw a medical test result that lists “coronavirus.” what should i do?,"keep in mind that ""coronavirus"" is actually a broad term that describes a whole family of viruses, many of which cause the common cold. the current global outbreak is caused by a specific ""novel"" coronavirus that causes the disease covid-19.  
the vast majority of coronavirus diagnoses will be the equivalent of being told that you have a common cold or flu, so a positive coronavirus test result is not a cause for alarm. this can be very confusing, so please talk to your doctor or care team if you see this word used. 
should i be concerned about the coronavirus? how dangerous is it? is it treatable? what are the symptoms? 
chla has a separate blog post that helps explain the basics of the novel coronavirus available here: what you should know about the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19)"
is the virus that causes covid-19 found in feces (stool)?,"the virus that causes covid-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with covid-19. however, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing covid-19. there has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. however, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)."
what will happen to current special-use permits?,"special use permits will remain valid and in effect. monitoring work associated with permit administration may experience delays. valid permits issued for uses that focus on customer service, such as ski resorts, organizational camps, club activities, etc. will remain in effect and operations will be under the discretion of the organization or individual holding the permit."
i heard about antiviral medications available for covid-19.,"medications, such as remdesivir and others, are being evaluated as potential treatments for covid-19.  at this time, there are no fda-approved medications available to treat covid-19. please consult a licensed physician or other healthcare provider for additional recommendations about disease treatment."
"feed, play with, and walk your pet as you normally would.","for the most part, there’s no need to change the way you care for your pets on a day to day basis unless someone in your household is sick. keep your pets on their normal feeding schedules and play with them like you always do. this will help keep them happy during a stressful time.

your pets might sense that you’re stressed or worried, so they might get more stressed in response. try playing with them a little more often to keep them calm.
if you’re home from work during the outbreak, your pets might even be happier than normal."
what about indoor recreation?,"arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, escape rooms, and ice- and roller-skating rinks can reopen, but should operate at lesser of 50 customers or of 50 percent facility capacity. group fitness classes of up to 50 people can be held with at least 6-feet social distancing between individuals.  indoor playgrounds and trampoline parks are to remain closed."
businesses are required to check the temperature of employees upon discovery that the business has been exposed to a person who is a probable or confirmed covid-19 case. can these temperature checks be done by employees at home through self-screening?,"businesses are required to check the temperature of employees upon discovery that the business has been exposed to a person who is a probable or confirmed covid-19 case. however, the department of health recommends that employers check the temperature and or symptoms of all employees at the beginning of each shift, particularly in those areas of the commonwealth with high positive case numbers. this can be done in several ways:
if thermometers can be procured:

— employers may take their employees’ temperatures on site utilizing best practices.
— employees may self-screen taking their temperature at home with business-provided thermometers or their own personal thermometer.

if thermometers cannot be procured:

— employers may ask their employees to conduct a questionnaire-based screening at the worksite utilizing the department approved screening tool or equivalent.
— employees may self-screen by conducting a questionnaire-based screening at their home utilizing the department approved screening tool or equivalent.

if utilizing self-screening, businesses must also establish a policy for employees to report their temperature or symptoms to the employer on a daily basis. this policy should include a provision that would not allow employees with symptoms to come onto the worksite.
additionally, businesses should consider paid leave policies that incentivize workers to stay home when reporting symptoms, including a temperature of 100.4 f or higher. this would alleviate the potential of employees lying to avoid losing pay, or potentially losing jobs.
daily self-screening is encouraged even if the employee is not scheduled to enter the worksite. for example, if an employee is off for the weekend, performing a self -screening is not required but a matter of good public health."
"wipe the surface with dilute bleach, alcohol, or another epa-approved disinfectant.","once the surface is clean, use a clean sponge, cloth, rag, or pre-moistened disinfectant wipe to rub the entire surface with a disinfectant solution. make sure to use a generous amount, since the surface needs to be visibly wet for several minutes in order for most disinfectants to work. keep your work area well-ventilated and follow any instructions on the label of your disinfectant. 

to make a bleach solution, use 5 tablespoons (74 ml) of bleach for every 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water. never mix bleach with ammonia or other household cleaners, since this can create toxic fumes.
any alcohol solution containing at least 70% isopropyl alcohol is also effective at killing the coronavirus.
you can view a complete list of all disinfectants approved by the epa for use against the coronavirus here: https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2."
who do i contact for questions about my grant?,"please contact the national program leader listed as contact for your program. for questions about awards, please contact nifa at awards@usda.gov to consult with a grant."
can i gather in larger groups for any reason?,"you should only be socialising in groups of up to two households (including your support bubble) indoors and outdoors or up to six people from different households when outdoors.
more generally, you can continue to meet in larger groups if necessary for work, voluntary or charitable services, education, childcare or training, elite sporting competition or training, to fulfil legal obligations, to provide emergency assistance, or to enable someone to avoid illness, injury or risk of harm.
it is otherwise against the law for gatherings of more than 30 people to take place in private homes (including gardens and other outdoor spaces). businesses and venues following covid-19 secure guidelines can host larger groups. this is also the case for events in public outdoor spaces that are organised by businesses, charitable or political organisations, and public bodies, provided they take reasonable steps to mitigate the risk of transmission, in line with covid-19 secure guidance and including completion of a risk assessment. this can include weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and funerals (which we advise should be limited to no more than 30 people), religious ceremonies and services, community activities and support groups. any other gathering in an outdoor space or in a private home (or garden) must not be any larger than 30 people."
apply for unemployment benefits if you need it.,"unemployment programs are designed to help people in your situation. since unemployment rose sharply when the outbreak hit, many countries have expanded their unemployment benefits to help people through the crisis. if you can’t find work, then apply for benefits. this can keep you on your feet until you find stable work. 

different states and countries have different processes of applying for unemployment benefits. contact the relevant office in your state or country and follow the process to apply for benefits.
in most cases, you have to prove that you’re looking for work to qualify for benefits, so continue searching the same way that you were before."
how can you tell when covid-19 has run its course?,"typically, symptoms will be relatively mild, so it can be difficult to know for sure exactly when you're no longer contagious. your public health department will monitor you while you’re in quarantine and tell you when you’re clear to leave your home or the hospital. once your symptoms are gone for at least 24 hours, they’ll test you to see if you still have the virus. 
don’t leave your quarantine until the public health department confirms that it’s safe for you to do so. they may keep you in quarantine for several days after you're no longer symptomatic just in case."
take advantage of digital resources,"instead of a binge session of fortnite, have your child find an online class or training session to help maintain their skills or feel connected to their sport. right now, there are some fantastic free videos that offer general mobility or strength training as well as sport-specific drills. the experts or athletes are often conducting these classes out of their homes or backyards, so participating with minimal space is achievable. as a family, taking advantage of a free online yoga class can keep everyone limber and strong."
where can i find more information about monitoring myself after a potential covid-19 exposure?,"for more information on what you should do if you have been exposed to covid-19

catch up on popular tv shows and movies to pass the time.,"while you’re homebound, take advantage of this opportunity to enjoy shows you’ve been wanting to watch. you might also re-watch your favorites. just make sure to break up your binge sessions with other activities, like getting in some exercise. if you want to watch something with your friends or family, try out netflix’s new feature called “netflix party,” which allows people to watch the same show together even though they’re in different homes."
take multivitamin supplements if you have any deficiencies.,"most people get enough vitamins and minerals from their regular diet as long as they eat right. it’s possible, however, that you might have some deficiencies from your regular diet. if you get sick often or feel run down, you could have a nutrient deficiency. speak to your doctor and if they recommend it, start taking a multivitamin supplement to replace any missing nutrients. 

your doctor can usually tell if you have any nutrient deficiencies with a simple blood test.
remember that your body can only process so many vitamins and will expel any extras through your urine. if you already get enough vitamins, then you’re not adding anything to your body by taking a supplement too.
talk to your doctor before taking vitamin supplements. some types are better than others, and your doctor can recommend the best product for you.
you usually only need to take a multivitamin if you’re pregnant or have had bariatric surgery since there are known risks for deficiency. otherwise, multivitamins may not have as many benefits.
multivitamins are not regulated by the food and drug administration, so research the product before using it to make sure it’s made by a reputable company."
when should i seek medical attention?,"if you develop any of these emergency warning signs for the disease, you should seek medical attention immediately: 
trouble breathing
persistent pain or pressure in the chest
new confusion or inability to arouse
bluish lips or face
 this list is not all inclusive. please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.call 911 if you have a medical emergency. notify the operator that you have or think you might have covid-19. if possible, put on a mask or cloth face covering before medical help arrives."
continue adopting and sheltering pets if you do this normally.,"the cdc does not see any risk in bringing new animals into your home during an outbreak. if you regularly shelter or adopt pets, then you don’t have to stop during the outbreak. 
always make sure to bathe any new animals thoroughly when you take them home. this is good practice whether there is a covid-19 outbreak or not."
what type of mask should children wear?,"children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask. this provides source control, meaning it keeps the virus from being transmitted to others if they are infected and are not aware that they are infected. the adult who is providing the mask should ensure the fabric mask is the correct size and sufficiently covers the nose, mouth and chin of the child. children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis, cancer or immunosuppression, should, in consultation with their medical providers, wear a medical mask. a medical mask controls spreading of the virus and protection to the wearer, and is recommended for anyone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from covid-19."
do vitamin d levels affect your risk for coronavirus? is there a correlation between vitamin d and those who test positive for covid-19?,"“to date, there is no evidence that very high vitamin d levels are protective against covid-19 and consequently medical guidance is that people should not be supplementing their vitamin d levels beyond those which are currently recommended by published medical advice,” wrote robin may, director of the institute of microbiology and infection at the university of birmingham in the uk. 
vitamin d is important for healthy muscles, strong bones and a powerful immune system. the recommended daily dose of vitamin d for anyone over age 1 is 15 mcg/600 iu per day in the us. for anyone over 70 years of age in the us, the recommended daily intake goes up to 20 mcg/800 iu per day.
but too much vitamin d can lead to a toxic buildup of calcium in your blood that can cause confusion, disorientation, heart rhythm problems, bone pain, kidney damage and painful kidney stones."
freeze the milk if you want to use it later.,"commercial milk cartons have indentations that allow the carton to expand as it freezes. that means even if you haven't opened the milk, you can pop the whole carton into your freezer, where it will keep for up to 6 months. 
when you're ready to use the milk, move it into the refrigerator and allow it to thaw for 1-2 days. gently swirl the container before you use it in case the milk separated."
"my partner is an emt and still going to work.  i am out of work and have been self-quarantining.  we do not live together, so what is the proper and responsible way to interact?","try using a video calling service, like skype, facetime, or facebook messenger. since your partner is an emt, they may have become exposed to covid-19, so it's probably best to avoid in-person contact."
follow up with your child a few days after your talk.,"your child may think of new questions or worries after you talk to them. additionally, they may hear new information from someone else. talk to them again a few days after your first talk to make sure everything is okay. 

you might say, “i thought we had a good conversation about the coronavirus the other day. did you have any followup questions you wanted to ask?”
don’t talk about the coronavirus every day unless your child is bringing it up. discussing it too often may make your child worry more."
"stick with mainstream sources known for accurate, unbiased reporting.","like most people, you might not have time to research everything you hear in the news. in this case, try to get your everyday news from outlets known for accuracy and unbiased reporting. an organization with a good track record for accuracy is probably trustworthy during the covid-19 outbreak. 

some organizations that consistently earn high marks for accuracy are reuters, wall street journal, new york times, npr, bloomberg, and the bbc.
weekly or monthly publications that have good reputations are foreign affairs, the atlantic, and the new yorker.

how should employees maintain safe distance from one another during food production and processing?,"who guidelines are to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) between fellow workers. where the food production environment makes it difficult to do so, employers need to consider what measures to put in place to protect employees. examples of practical measures to adhere to physical distancing guidance in the food processing environment are to:stagger workstations on either side of processing lines so that food workers are not facing one another,provide personal protection equipment (ppe) such as face masks, hair nets, disposable gloves, clean overalls and slip reduction work shoes for staff. the use of ppe would be routine in high risk areas of food premises that produce ready-to-eat and cooked foods. when staff are dressed in ppe it is possible to reduce distance between workers,space out workstations, which may require reduction in the speed of production lines,limit the number of staff in a food preparation area at any one time,organise staff into working groups or teams to facilitate reduced interaction between groups, including during change of work shifts."
wash your hands frequently when you have contact with them.,"whenever you are near the person or handle items that they’ve touched, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. if you can’t get to soap and water right away, rub your hands all over with a hand sanitizer that’s at least 60% alcohol until they feel dry. 
if possible, use paper towels to dry your hands, then throw them away immediately. if you don’t have paper towels, use clean cloth towels and change them out for fresh ones at least once a day."
are there ways to measure the economic impact of reopening to compare it to the immediate health risks?,"the economic toll inflicted by covid-19 and the corresponding efforts to contain its spread has been devastating. both workers and businesses as well as government’s fiscal capacity have been significantly affected by the crisis. thus, as some jurisdictions have made progress in controlling the outbreak, demand for reopening businesses and increasing commercial opportunities has increased significantly. but too fast or widespread a reopening runs the risk of triggering further outbreaks and reversing any progress that has been made, not only in terms of protecting human health and but also with reinvigorating the economy. 
closing was, ironically, the easy part.  as a city leader, you are now balancing three criteria to assess opening up: contact intensity (gyms are different than dry cleaners); number of contacts (500 is different than 5 people in an enclosed space); and the possibility of modifications to minimize the risks (ppe, one-way lanes in markets, limited seating, etc.)
it should also be noted that different jurisdictions will face considerably different sets of circumstances when assessing the risks. for instance, the economic impacts of covid-19 are shaping up (so far) to be unevenly distributed across the united states.   opportunity insights economic tracker has information on the economic impacts of covid-19 on people, businesses, and communities across the united states in real time. (juliette kayyem, 5/19/20)"
allow the technician to swab your nose and/or throat.,"the primary tests for coronavirus are nasopharyngeal (nose) and oropharyngeal (throat) swabs. during these tests, try to hold as still as possible while the technician uses a swab to collect samples from both areas. while you might experience some discomfort, the test shouldn't be painful. 
the technician will have to hold the swabs at the back of your nose and throat for 5-10 seconds, which may feel slightly uncomfortable. just try to relax and breathe—it will be over soon."
what are an employer’s obligations to an employee who is under government-imposed quarantine?,"​the pennsylvania department of labor & industry is encouraging employers to be accommodating and flexible with workers.employers may offer alternative work arrangements, such as teleworking and additional paid time off to employees, but are not under legal obligation to do so.the federal government has also enacted the families first coronavirus response act (ffcra), which provides paid sick leave and extended family and medical leave act (fmla) protections.please refer to the united states department of labor for additional questions regarding paid sick leave and extended fmla benefits."
set a regular time to check the news so you can stay informed.,"when you’re sheltering in place, it’s crucial to keep yourself informed of the situation so that you can be aware of any major changes or actions you need to take to stay safe. however, looking at the news too much can be stressful and scary. give yourself a specific amount of time each day to look at updates from a reliable source. 

for example, if you’re sheltering in place due to the coronavirus outbreak, you might stick to looking at updates from the cdc, the world health organization, or your local public health department.
if you watch or read the news, you might limit yourself to just 15 minutes a day or only 2-3 stories at a time. you know best how much you can handle before it starts to really stress you out.
be conscious of how others in the home are affected, too. for example, avoid exposing children to lots of frightening media coverage. summarize what’s going on for them in a straightforward way, but don’t leave the tv on 24/7 so that they hear all the scariest stories about what’s happening."
use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.,"if you can’t wash your hands, the next best thing is to use hand sanitizer. pick one with an alcohol content of at least 60%. pump a small amount of the gel into the palm of one hand, then rub your hands together until you’ve coated all surfaces of both hands. keep rubbing until your hands feel completely dry, which usually takes about 20 seconds. 
hand sanitizer doesn’t work as well if your hands are visibly dirty. if this is the case, try to at least rinse the dirt off your hands with running water first, even if you don’t have soap."
​i am self-employed and my income and hours have declined greatly because of covid-19. am i eligible for pua?,"​self-employed individuals, independent contractors, or gig workers who are unable to work because of covid-19 and have had to suspend their work may be eligible for pua."

i have an appointment at cleveland clinic. what do i need to bring?,"please bring your appointment reminder with you (email, mychart or text message). when entering any cleveland clinic location, you and any permitted visitors (see visitor restrictions) will be screened for potential covid-19 symptoms, including a temperature scan. in some locations, we use no-contact, hand-held thermal scanners. in other places, we use a thermal imaging system you walk through and might not even notice. you’ll be asked to sanitize your hands.
for a routine appointment or procedure (without a hospital stay), and emergency department visits, patients are required to wear a mask while inside our facilities, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. patients admitted to the hospital are strongly encouraged to wear a mask while inside our ohio and florida facilities. masks from home may be worn, or masks will be provided at entrances."
what are the types of coronavirus (covid-19) tests?,"the two main types of tests for coronavirus look for either a current infection
               or a past infection.
to check if someone is infected with coronavirus, health care providers look for
               pieces of the virus in a sample of saliva (spit)
               or mucus. these tests can tell if the person is infected on the day of the
               test.
health care providers can:

use a long swab (like a q-tip) to take a sample from inside the nose (at the start
               of the nostrils, the middle of the nose, or the very back of the nose), the throat,
               the inside of the cheeks, or along the gums or tongue.
give the person a container to spit or cough into.

people can get the test in a doctor's office or other testing sites (such as pharmacies
               or pop-up sites). some areas offer drive-thru
               testing, which lets people stay in their car during the test. at some testing
               sites, people can swab themselves following directions from the health care team.
               there also are special kits that families can order to do the test at home.
depending on the type of test and where it was done, results can be ready that
               day or take a week or longer if the test went to a lab. currently, home kits always
               go to a lab. results might take longer if a community does many tests at the same
               time.
a ""positive"" test means a person is infected with coronavirus, and a ""negative""
               test means they aren't infected. but sometimes the test results aren't accurate. a
               test result can be negative even when someone has the virus. this is why some people
               get a second test. rarely, the test may be positive in someone who doesn't have the
               virus.
inaccurate test results are more likely when someone is tested very early or very
               late in their infection. they tend to be more accurate when done a few days after
               someone was around an infected person or symptoms started.
before the test, make sure you understand the instructions. for a swab test, help
               your child stay still so the health care provider can get a good sample. the better
               the sample, the more accurate the results.
to see if someone had coronavirus in the past, health care providers look for antibodies, which the body
               makes after an infection. it can tell if someone had an infection in the past, at
               least 2–3 weeks before the test. that's how long it takes the body to make antibodies
               after infection. it can't tell if the person is infected at the time of the
               test, which is why this test isn't used to diagnose covid-19.
this is a blood test, with a sample taken either from a vein or a fingertip (called
               a ""fingerstick""). results can be ready on the same day, or up to a week later. there's
               no home kit for antibody testing yet.
health experts aren't sure whether antibodies protect a person from future coronavirus
               infections. and if they do, it's not clear for how long."
get creative with arts and crafts.,"whether you’re a master artist or can’t manage much more than a stick figure, making art can lower stress.  it’s also a great way to express your feelings in a safe and healthy manner. do some doodling, coloring, knitting, or whatever kind of project strikes your fancy. 

doing arts and crafts is a fantastic way to bond with kids and keep them busy while they’re stuck at home. search for kid-friendly arts and crafts projects online.
you can also play simple art games with anyone who’s staying with you. for example, give everyone a piece of paper and have them start drawing. when everyone has drawn a little, have someone in the group shout “change!” then, everyone passes their paper to the person to their right. add onto the drawing you just received until the next person says “change.”
if you’re sheltering alone, try a social drawing app or website like aggie, drawesome, or drawize."
​i'd like more information about covid-19.  where can i find the best sources for information?,​the centers for disease control (cdc) and the pa department of health are reliable sources for information regarding covid-19.  please visit https://www.cdc.gov/ or https://www.health.pa.gov for more information.
but will not socializing with other children stunt my kid’s development?,"probably not, although it does make sense to worry.  
social interactions are an important part of development throughout childhood, and spending time with peers is typically part of that process. but try not to fret too much about what kids are missing right now. children are resilient and adaptable, and they’re not entirely cut off from other people. 
there is much to be gained from interactions with parents, siblings and even pets. time alone is valuable, too. and connection through technology, like hanging out or playing games through video chats, can fill in some of the blanks. even without peer interaction for a while, kids can still develop socially and emotionally in ways that will prepare them to pursue real-world friendships when those can resume. 
friendship is like riding a bicycle. you don’t really forget how, even if you have some time away."
are there opportunities for veterans to contribute as volunteers during the covid-19 pandemic?,"all volunteers are encouraged to visit www.michigan.gov/fightcovid19 to register as a volunteer. this site will allow volunteers to register in the most appropriate area (local volunteer, medical volunteer, public health volunteer, etc.)."
"once a school starts in distance learning, is it required to remain that way for the entire quarter, semester?","no.  education code section 43504 specifies that schools should ""offer in-person instruction to the greatest extent possible.""  however, in-person instruction should be conducted only if the conditions are safe for both students and staff.  if a school starts in distance learning, school and public health officials should collaborate to prepare to reopen for in-person instruction as soon as practicable."
does vitamin d help prevent or treat covid-19?,"vitamin d is among the many medications being studied in the prevention and treatment of covid-19. however, researchers are still trying to evaluate vitamin d's role in preventing or treating covid-19, and there are no established recommendations for its use at this time. it is important to discuss with your physician whether vitamin d supplementation may be appropriate for you."
what patients are being prioritized for drive-up and on-site testing?,"covid-19 testing will focus on high-risk patients. these are symptomatic patients who also have one of the following criteria:

61 & older.
under 36 months.
on immunosuppressive therapy.
end-stage renal disease and are on dialysis.
coronary artery disease.
heart failure reduced ejection fraction.
lung disease.
contact with a known covid-19 patient.
hiv/aids.
solid organ transplants.

these patients will continue to be tested at cleveland clinic drive-up testing sites with a cleveland clinic physician’s order."
contact 1-800-985-5990 if you’re having trouble coping with the outbreak.,"it can be really overwhelming to deal with the covid-19 outbreak on a day-to-day basis, especially if you know affected people or live in a hotspot. your feelings are completely normal, and are nothing to be ashamed of. call the disaster distress helpline—they’ll be happy to connect you with a counselor who can help you work through your concerns and fears. 
you can also text “talkwithus” to 66746 if you don’t want to talk on the phone."
i’m an incoming first-year student. can i defer? or take a gap year?,"many colleges are allowing you to do so, but check with your admissions counselor before you make a decision. you might be unpleasantly surprised. 
already, some colleges are bleeding students, as a large number of high school seniors have put off a decision about where to go to college in the fall — or whether to go at all.
if you can take a gap year, though, it might not be a terrible idea. 
for some families, lost income makes it impossible to consider paying tuition right now. for others, it’s more about a refusal to forgo the yearned-for experiences of university life outside the classroom — giggling through late nights with roommates, exploring new interests through campus clubs, playing or cheering for sports teams — for a pale, zoom-fueled imitation. they’d rather take a year off and try again in 2021.
if you take a year off without a clear plan, try to set clear goals for yourself and design your own curriculum, even if you are holding down a job to support your family. read what you want to read, try your hand at a new language and enlist a mentor to help you find your way through this strange time."
join a support group online.,"during social distancing measures, you may not be able to meet with a support group in person. try to look for online grief support groups or counselors so you can share your experience and relate to others. 

talkspace and betterhelp both provide online counseling that you can access from your phone or computer.
your healthcare provider may also be able to connect you with an online support group or counselor."
what actions are recommended to protect north carolinians from contracting covid-19 when they are not at home?,"north carolinians are encouraged to limit non-essential travel and stay at home if they are sick. people can protect themselves against the spread of covid-19 remembering the three ws:
wear a cloth face covering.
wash your hands for 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer.
wait 6 feet apart from other people to keep your distance."
who is funding the county’s covid-19 response?,"san mateo county is working with fiscal partners at the local,
  state and federal government levels to appropriate funds for our
  response to the novel coronavirus (covid-19.)"
make time for yourself outside of school.,"when you're learning at home, it can start to feel like all you ever do is schoolwork. sticking to a regular routine can help with that, but it's also important to deliberately carve out some time for things you enjoy. those are different for every person, but here are some places you might start: 

getting exercise or doing physical activities like sports
making art or music, doing crafts, writing, or journaling
doing a fun new look with makeup
spending time with your closest friends and family
watching your favorite shows and movies or listening to music you love
playing cards, board games, or video games
cooking or baking a tasty new recipe"
can i travel to visit my family or friends?,"travel increases your chances of getting and spreading covid-19. traveling may be especially dangerous if you or who you are visiting are high-risk for contracting covid-19. people at higher risk for severe illness need to take extra precautions. visit the cdc’s website for more.
visit gov. desantis’ reopening plan for more information on traveling: https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/plan-for-floridas-recovery/"
fact-check stories and information before you share it.,"a lot of unreliable information spreads online because people share it on social media. this amplifies its effects. if you come across news or information on social media, fact-check it with a reputable source like the cdc. if you can’t verify news, then don’t share it. 

feel free to share news that you can confirm. it’s good to spread quality information for people who need it.
you could help combat the fake news problem by only sharing verified and reputable sources."
"any updates on potential treatments, like remdesivir or antibody-type therapies?","remdesivir is an antiviral treatment that had a positive result in one randomized controlled study, showing that it could cut the number of days in the hospital. the research is ongoing. you have to examine where in the process it’s given—it was being given quite late to very sick patients. there are other studies taking place using it earlier in the timeline to see if it could be more effective then. 
the studies on immunity are moving ahead, and there remains a fair amount of hope for the convalescent serum and other types of antibody products to provide some protection. it'll be about two months before we get results. recent evidence has indicated that most people tend to make antibodies, which is good. we also know that there are antibodies that really do neutralize the virus. the most promising short-term treatment option could be antibody-type therapies, and perhaps in summer we'll get evidence that they provide some benefit. that could really help slow the spread, even if it's not available to everyone. preventive antibody treatment could help safeguard first responders and healthcare workers or nursing home residents and staff. 
we’re still using social distancing to buy time for science to come to the rescue. there are many different scientists working on this challenge and so many different ways to approach it. we don't need everything to work. we just need a few things to work. we're in the difficult time before we get that breakthrough, and we're just trying to buy time for progress. (dr. josh sharfstein, 5/13/20)"
what is a “gathering”?,"a gathering refers to any kind of event or convening of people from separate households in a coordinated fashion.
    this includes events like fairs, picnics, conferences, religious worship, performances, and parties. except for
    outdoor religious and cultural ceremonies and protests, all gatherings are prohibited until further notice, except
    as otherwise specifically permitted in state public health directives (including in applicable industry guidance).
     for the limited types of outdoor gatherings that are currently, everyone hosting or attending the gathering
    must follow all the requirements in the county health officer’s mandatory directive for gatherings."
how can i protect myself against coronavirus-related scams?,"the coronavirus pandemic has brought new scams, including those that target stimulus checks, online tools, promises of new treatments, and charity donations.you can take these steps to protect your identity and finances during this time:
use only irs.gov to register for or get information about your stimulus check (also called an economic impact payment). remember, unless you've asked to be contacted, the irs will never contact you to ask for personal or financial information or ask you to open an attachment or visit a website link. for more information, go to the irs website.
protect your information when using online tools and mobile applications. for step-by-step instructions on how to securely access and manage your va health care and other benefits, visit our videos for privacy best practices for veterans (youtube) and authentication methods for signing in to mobile apps and va.gov (youtube).
stay aware of the latest scams. go the federal trade commission (ftc) website for tips on how to avoid coronavirus-related scams.
protect your identity at all times. research shows scammers and identity thieves often target veterans. visit our identity theft prevention website for tips and resources to help you protect your identity."
sleep at least 7 hours each night.,"try to go to bed at a pretty consistent time each night. with this in mind, aim to wake up around the same time each morning. get at least 7 hours of sleep each night, which will help you feel refreshed and energized as possible as you make your way through your semester. 
for instance, try to go to bed by 12:00 am and wake up by 7:00 am at the earliest."
"if my pet was around someone who is diagnosed with covid-19, should i be worried?","since there have been a few confirmed reports of pets becoming sick with covid-19 in the united states, it is still recommended that people sick with covid-19 limit contact with animals. contact your veterinarian if your pet displays any signs of illness."
ask them what they know about the covid-19 outbreak.,"it’s helpful to understand their viewpoint before you dive into your concerns. give them a chance to tell you what they’ve read or heard about the coronavirus. pay attention to where they got their facts and why they believe the situation isn’t serious. 

say, “this coronavirus outbreak is really scary to me. what do you think about it?”
don’t interrupt them or try to counter what they’re saying. it’s likely that this will make them feel defensive, so they won’t be very open to what you have to say. try to keep in mind that they have a reason for believing the information they have."
is it correct that if someone in your home is ill then you should also be staying at home?,"yes. if people in the home are coughing, have fevers or other symptoms of the coronavirus, this is good advice. as testing scales up, advice may change. (dr. josh shafstein, 3/19/20)"
what happens when you get covid-19 and it’s bad enough that you need to be treated in the hospital?,"most hospital care involves management of conditions that happen as a result of a covid-19 infection, for instance, pneumonia or severe respiratory distress. most treatment for these conditions includes respiratory support. this support may be high-flow oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, or in rare cases organ support with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth or nose into the windpipe coupled with mechanical ventilation.
therapies that specifically target the covid-19 virus, such as antivirals, are in various stages of development and testing. for one patient suffering from coronavirus in the us, doctors were granted compassionate use permission from the food and drug administration to test an experimental drug outside of a clinical trial. when the clinical trials are concluded, we'll learn whether the drug, remdesivir, is effective for the treatment of covid-19 patients.
drafted 17 march 2020"
avoid exaggerating the illness and spreading misinformation.,"do your best to hold yourself accountable for the information you share with others. it can be really easy to get caught up in the hysteria and panic of the pandemic, but try not to let these feelings take control. instead, think about what you plan on saying before you actually say it. if your words aren’t spreading factual information, then you probably shouldn’t be saying them. 
for instance, avoid sharing information like “i saw on social media that…” or “a friend told me…” instead, only share verified information that’s backed by medical professionals or scientific experts."
who will wear a mask?,"you'll probably see lots of health care people wearing masks. doctors and nurses
               will wear them. medical people who give therapies and treatments will wear masks.
               they also might wear clear face shields or plastic glasses. those can help stop germs
               too. in the hospital, people who keep the rooms
               clean, give directions, bring meal trays, and bring supplies also will wear masks.
while coronavirus is going around, doctors might see people with video visits instead
               of in person. they don't need to wear a mask for that.
anyone can wear a mask when they need to be near other people. many people who
               work at stores and restaurants will wear them. a mask is an extra way to stop germs.
               some people might wear a homemade cloth mask. some might wear scarves or bandannas
               to cover their nose and mouth."
will my health plan cover telemedicine for testing or treatment of coronavirus?,"yes. all individual and small group health insurers are covering telemedicine services. this includes audio or visual communications. if you have specific questions about your coverage, contact your health plan."
would surveys with less-than-normal response rates be released?,"nass only publishes estimates that meet our high standards of accuracy. the quality of the data is impacted by the quality of response. we use proven statistical methods that account for a certain level of non-response. while there are minimum amounts of data that we need to collect for reporting accuracy, we use statistical analysis to determine if the data we have collected are sufficient."
what steps can employers who are reopening take to protect their employees?,"effective may 11, 2020, and unless otherwise permitted or required by this order, all employers shall take reasonable steps, where practicable as work duties permit, to protect their employees by: 
maintaining six feet of separation between employees;
regularly disinfecting frequently used items and surfaces;
encouraging handwashing;
preventing employees who are sick from coming into contact with other persons;
facilitating remote working arrangements; and
minimizing employee travel.
 in addition to complying with the requirements of the current safer at home health order, employers are strongly encouraged to read and implement the alabama department of public health's guidelines for safeguarding all businesses."
volunteer at a shelter if you are able to.,"many shelters do not have the amount of staff that they need right now to keep their operations running. if you are not experiencing symptoms of covid-19 and you are not at a high risk for the virus, reach out to your local shelter to see if you can assist in any way. 

people who are 65 and older and those who have weakened immune systems are more at risk for covid-19.
if you have any background medical knowledge or experience, you will be extremely valuable at a shelter."
apply for remote or work-from home positions.,"remote work has increased dramatically in recent years, and many people already worked from home when the outbreak started. companies that already have a work-from-home structure are weathering the ordeal much better than brick-and-mortar businesses that are expensive to run. search online for remote work in your field for a more stable option. there is some remote work in almost all sectors. 

some traditional fields where remote work is popular are data entry, writing and editing, accounting, video editing, sales, and help desk. these fields will probably use even more remote workers during the outbreak.
with widespread quarantines in place, some new industries are increasing their use of remote workers. schools are using remote teachers and tutors, banks and financial firms are offering virtual consultations, and hospitals are offering virtual doctors' appointments. try checking your specific field to see if companies are transferring to remote positions.
finding remote work is the same as searching for other work. go to a job site like indeed and set the filter to “remote” to see what’s available.
there are also some specialized websites, like remote.co, that only advertise remote jobs."
5g helps sars-cov-2 spread,"as the world becomes more connected, some regions are rolling out 5g mobile technology. a raft of conspiracy theories appear wherever this technology sets foot. one of the most recent theories to emerge is that 5g is responsible for the swift spread of sars-cov-2 across the globe. some people claim that 5g helps viruses communicate, often citing a paper from 2011. in this study, the authors conclude that bacteria can communicate via electromagnetic signals. however, experts dispute this theory, and sars-cov-2 is a virus, not a bacterium. wuhan was one of the first cities to trial 5g in china, which helps explain the origin of some of these theories. however, beijing, shanghai, and guangzhou also rolled out 5g at a similar time. it is also worth noting that covid-19 has significantly impacted countries with very little 5g coverage, such as iran. learn about the health implications of 5g in depth here."

when is it safe not to wear a face covering?,when you’re at home with no guests; when you’re outside and can maintain six feet of physical distance from others outside your household; when you’re riding alone or with your household members in a car.
how is the food and nutrition service helping food banks during this public health emergency?,"food banks are private, non-profit entities who work in their local communities to gather donations and distribute foods to those in need who may not be accessing other assistance programs. fns partners with food banks and other state distributing agencies by providing usda foods through the emergency food assistance program (tefap) and commodity supplemental food program (csfp). usda has provided states broad discretion to set eligibility limits for tefap and ensured that states can take limited eligibility information such as name, address, and self-reported income via telephone, text or other electronic means, or by receiving a 1-page affidavit in a dropbox. the families first coronavirus response act, signed into law by president trump on march 18, 2020 provided usda an additional $400 million for tefap, up to $100 million of which can be used to help agencies cover costs associated with distributing a higher volume of food due to covid-19. the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security (cares) act, signed into law by president trump on march 27, 2020 provided an additional $450 million for tefap. when a localized need is identified, such as disrupted food supply, food banks should check with their state agency regarding a disaster household distribution program."
are parks open? are campgrounds open?,"state parks
state parks and forests are open.
on days of high visitation, some parks may close early. as visitors leave, parks may reopen. before visiting, check the new jersey state park services' facebook page for closing and reopening announcements.
swimming is currently being phased in at state parks, forests, and recreation areas. for the latest updates on openings, refer to the department of environmental protections' swim schedule.
to save lives and stop the spread of covid-19, wear a mask, wash your hands, practice social distancing, and stay home if you are sick. face coverings are required in indoor public spaces like park restrooms, gatehouses, and buildings, as well as in outdoor public spaces when social distancing is difficult to maintain.

require attendees to be six feet apart at all times, excluding immediate family members, caretakers, household members, or romantic partners;
prohibit contact between attendees;
if the event is an organized gathering, the organizer should demarcate six feet of spacing in the area of the gathering to demonstrate appropriate spacing for social distancing;
prohibit sharing of any physical items provided and require sanitization before and after each use; and
require contactless pay options wherever feasible.

state police and local police will regularly patrol parks to ensure that proper social distancing protocol is followed.
for more on mandatory requirements for outdoor gatherings, refer to section 2 of executive order no. 152.
note: there are exceptions for first amendment-protected outdoor activities, such as political protests of any persuasion or outdoor religious services, where outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people are allowed.

are summer camps open? what are the social distancing requirements and restrictions?,"as of july 6, youth day camps, including municipal summer programs, may operate so long as they comply with required social distancing and other mitigation policies.
residential and overnight camps are prohibited from operating.
to help protect the health and safety of our children, camp workers, and communities against the spread of covid-19, the department of health has released the following guidelines for youth summer camps which include:

campers and staff must be screened for fever or signs of covid-19 illness prior to being permitted to enter the facility or participating in camp programming. persons that have a fever or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the camp.
campers and staff members should be educated on steps to prevent the spread of covid-19.
groups should include the same children each day with the same staff person, if possible. mixing between groups should be restricted. camps should avoid communal dining and stagger mealtimes to ensure social distancing of groups. surfaces should be cleaned and sanitized between each meal service.
staff are encouraged to wear cloth masks while working unless (1) doing so would inhibit the individual's health, (2) the individual is in extreme heat outdoors, or (3) the individual is in water.
cloth face coverings for staff and campers should be worn when social distancing of 6 feet between assigned groups cannot be maintained. cloth face coverings should not be put on children under age two because of the danger of suffocation.
all youth camps are prohibited from off-site activities, engaging in full-contact sports and providing resident or overnight camp activities.
handwash and hand sanitizers stations should be provided in numerous areas around the camp.
common surfaces and rooms should be cleaned at least daily including restrooms and countertops.
gloves should be worn when handling or serving food to campers.
social distancing is encouraged during bussing/transportation to and from camp. vehicles should be cleaned and disinfected between each use. face coverings should be worn when social distancing can't be maintained.

for a full list of required safety policies, refer to department of health's executive directive 20-021.
to open, youth camps must submit application form at least 14 days prior to the start date of camp activities and attestation form at least 24 hours prior to opening. for these forms and detailed guidance on youth summer camp standards, refer to the department of health's youth camps page.
swimming pools
summer camps may use their pools when they reopen, so long as they comply with required safety protocols.
pools must follow the appropriate requirements from executive order no. 153, executive order no. 157, and the department of health's executive directive 20-022 and covid-19 pools and aquatic recreation facility standards, including developing and implementing a covid-19 pool operation prevention plan that must be submitted to and approved by the local health authority.
safety grants for youth camps
up to $20 million in grants is available to help child care centers and youth camps meet health and safety guidelines in response to covid-19.
youth camps can receive up to $2,000 to purchase additional cleaning products, personal protective equipment, and other products and services. the providers must be registered with the nj workforce registry and must apply through the new jersey child care information system (njccis).

can i use public transport if i’m seeing friends in a park or going to my parents’ garden?,"you can help control coronavirus and travel safely by walking and cycling, if you can. however where this is not possible, you can use public transport or drive. if you do use public transport, you must wear a face covering and you should follow the safer travel guidance for passengers."
what can i do to protect myself and others from covid-19?,"the following actions help prevent the spread of covid-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza:
avoid close contact with people who are sick.
avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
stay home when you are sick.
cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces every day. high touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. a list of products suitable for use against covid-19 is available here. this list has been pre-approved by the us environmental protection agency (epa) for use during the covid-19 outbreak.
wash your hands often with soap and water."
write to a pen pal in your family or community.,"some people don't feel comfortable chatting on the phone or computer, so send a letter. avoid writing about the news or things that are making you anxious. instead, focus on the positives and ask about how the other person is doing. try to keep your letter lighthearted. 
this is a great activity for kids since it helps them practice writing and makes them feel special when they get mail addressed to them."
"does the 60-person limit on outdoor gatherings mean that more than 60 people can attend the gathering over
        the course of the event, so long as no more than 60 people are present at any time?","no. the entire gathering is limited to 60 people total. this means that if 60 people are at a ceremony, nobody else
    is allowed to join the gathering even if somebody leaves. the designated host must keep a list of all attendees at
    the gathering, and no more than 60 people may be on that list."
should i also stay 6 feet (1.8 m) away from others while wearing a mask?,"yes, you should. masks are only so effective at preventing the spread of covid-19, and staying away from others is still the best way to avoid spreading the virus. even if you’re wearing a mask, you should still keep as far away from others as you can. wash your hands often and avoid touching your face while out and about."
honor your loved one with a small gathering.,"unfortunately, it may not be possible to hold a large funeral for your loved one while still maintaining a social distance. you can hold a small gathering of fewer than 10 people to remember your loved one and their life. 
talk to your funeral director about hosting a virtual event so you can invite more people to honor your loved one."
should i go to the doctor or dentist for nonurgent appointments?,"many medical and dental practices now have sufficient personal protective equipment and have instituted comprehensive safety measures to help protect you, the doctor and office staff, and other patients. if you feel anxious about visiting in person, call the practice.many doctor's offices are increasingly providing telehealth services. this may mean appointments by phone call, or virtual visits using a video chat service. ask to schedule a telehealth appointment with your doctor for a new or ongoing nonurgent matter. if, after speaking to you, your doctor would like to see you in person, he or she will let you know.what if your appointments are not urgent but also don't fall into the low-risk category? for example, if you have been advised to have periodic scans after cancer remission, if your doctor sees you regularly to monitor for a condition for which you're at increased risk, or if your treatment varies based on your most recent test results? in these and similar cases, call your doctor for advice."
call lenders and service providers to keep them apprised of your situation.,"lenders and service providers understand the financial effects of the pandemic generally, but they have no way of knowing how the crisis has impacted you personally unless you tell them. while some lenders and service providers are extending blanket relief to all of their customers, others only help if you contact them and ask for it. 

this can apply to your creditors, as well as your utility providers and landlord or mortgage holder. 

when you call, be prepared to explain your situation, how much you can afford to pay, and when you anticipate that you might be able to resume regular payments. if you don't know, that's okay —everyone is dealing with a great deal of uncertainty. just try to make your best assessment of your situation.
if you're calling about a mortgage or rent payments, you should also be prepared to discuss your income, assets, and other expenses."
get their attention before you start talking to them.,"sometimes, patients who are in the middle or late stages of alzheimer's might not notice that you're speaking to them. before you try to have a conversation, sit with them face-to-face and say their name so they know you're talking to them. 

if they don't respond right away, repeat their name a few times. however, make sure to pause each time you say their name because alzheimer's patients might need more time to react. 

you may need to use a powerful voice to get their attention, but don't yell, or else they might become startled or confused."
what public health guidance is there for reopening playgrounds?,"due to the difficulty of keeping playground equipment disinfected, the national recreation and park association does not recommend reopening playgrounds until there is no longer widespread community transmission. (dr. josh sharfstein, 5/27/20)"
"twice last year i was hospitalized for sepsis that was in my bloodstream.  i have copd. i started coughing, have difficulty breathing and a low grade fever that continues to increase. what should i do?","if you believe you have covid-19, notify the health authorities and isolate yourself for 14 days. coughing, difficulty breathing, and a fever are symptoms associated with the coronavirus. phone your doctor for advice as to where to seek help."
"if a t35 program is shortened, will the trainees’ stipend be decreased?","yes, if the appointment is shortened, the stipend will decrease accordingly."
encourage them to seek quiet time alone when they need it.,"alone time can often reduce stress in autistic people, so it's a good option if they are starting to feel tense. 

designate a quiet area where they can retreat. it should be a low-traffic area so they're less likely to be disturbed.
encourage family members to say when they want to be alone and to respect each other's wishes.
provide earplugs, noise-canceling headphones, and quiet music to help drown out background noise."
what commercial manufacturers are distributing serology test kits under the policy outlined in section iv.d of the policy for coronavirus disease-2019 tests? (updated 8/28),"as stated in section iv.d of the fda's policy for coronavirus disease-2019 tests, the fda does not intend to object to a commercial manufacturer's development and distribution of serology tests to identify antibodies to sars-cov-2 for a reasonable period of time, where the test has been validated and while the manufacturer is preparing its eua request, where the manufacturer gives notification to the fda and information that helps users and patients understand the test results, such as the following, is included in the instructions for use:
this test has not been reviewed by the fda.
negative results do not preclude acute sars-cov-2 infection. if acute infection is suspected, direct testing for sars-cov-2 is necessary.
results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude acute sars-cov-2 infection.
positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-sars-cov-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus hku1, nl63, oc43, or 229e.
as noted in the guidance, the fda believes that 10 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an eua submission for such tests. unless and until an eua is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test, under clia, use of that test is limited to laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing, and at the point-of-care when covered by the laboratory's clia certificate for high-complexity testing.
this policy does not apply to at-home testing, including at-home specimen collection.
the commercial manufacturers in the list below have notified the fda that they have validated and intend to distribute a serology test as set forth in section iv.d of the policy for coronavirus disease-2019 tests. where the authorization status is ""fda authorized,"" the fda reviewed and issued an eua for the test after notification was given. where the authorization status is shown as ""not fda authorized,"" the fda has not yet reviewed the manufacturer's validation and issued an eua for the manufacturer's test, and the test is included in this list to provide transparency regarding the notification submitted to the fda. the ""setting for use"" designation of ""h"" refers to a laboratory certified under clia to perform high-complexity testing. certain developers have completed the eua process prior to offering a test for clinical use rather than notify fda under this policy. tests that have been issued an eua can be found on the eua page.
if an eua request is not submitted within a reasonable period of time, or if significant problems are identified with a test and cannot be or have not been addressed in a timely manner, fda intends to remove the manufacturer and test from this list, would expect the manufacturer to suspend distribution of the test, and may take additional actions as appropriate.
manufacturers that have notified fda that they have validated and intend to distribute serology tests as set forth in section iv.d:

what will change in phase 3 and when will that happen?,"phase 2 will be in place until data shows the state is prepared to move forward with phase 3. phase 3 will likely ease even more restrictions on businesses and increase occupancy and mass gathering limits, but this is subject to the data. social distancing, hand hygiene and use of cloth face coverings will still be recommended. depending on state covid-19 trends, restrictions may be lifted more slowly or some restrictions may have to be reinstated to ensure the health and safety of north carolinians."
what if my child needs to go to the hospital?,"if your child’s healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including covid-19

ask the healthcare provider to let the hospital know you are coming and to share important information about caring for your child.
visiting policies may have changed due to covid-19. if your child’s hospital policy does not allow an adult to stay with a child, ask your child’s healthcare provider for a statement explaining your child’s need for a familiar adult to be present.
bring your care plans/emergency notebook with you along with paper and pen to write down questions you have during your time at the hospital."
where can i find the cities or zip codes of covid-19 cases?,"the alabama department of public health (adph) continues to review data related to covid-19. at this time, adph provides county level data on our covid-19 table and covid-19 data and surveillance dashboard. when providing zip code and additional information, especially in rural areas with small populations, considerations regarding patient identity and privacy have to be taken into account. additionally, zip code data does not give a true picture of where a person may have contracted the disease since people do no remain in one zip code."
how will this impact my local office and the services i need to receive?,"usda staff are available to continue helping agricultural producers with program signups, loan servicing, conservation planning assistance, and other important actions. producers can continue to apply for farm loan, disaster assistance, safety net, and conservation programs as well as crop insurance."
does who recommend routine wearing masks for healthy people during the 2019 ncov outbreak?,"no. who does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals prevents 2019-ncov
    transmission. masks are recommended to be used by symptomatic persons in the community. misuse and overuse of medical masks may cause serious issues of shortage of stocks and lack of mask availability for those who actually need to wear them. in health care facilities where health care workers are directly taking care of suspect or confirmed 2019-ncov acute respiratory disease patients, masks are an important part of containing 2019-ncov spread between people, along with other ppe and hand
    hygiene.click here for more information on medical mask use."
what is contact tracing?,"contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases.
contact tracing slows the spread of covid-19 by

letting people know they may have been exposed to covid-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of covid-19
helping people who may have been exposed to covid-19 get tested
asking people to self-isolate if they have covid-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with covid-19

during contact tracing, the health department staff will not ask you for

money
social security number
bank account information
salary information
credit card numbers"
set up a dedicated work area.,"if you have the space, try setting up a desk with a chair to put your computer on while you work. this will help you keep your school and personal life separate, and it can also trick your brain into getting focused once you sit down in front of your computer. 
not everyone has the space to dedicate an entire area to schoolwork, which is okay, too."
can someone spread the virus without being sick?,"people are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).  some spread might be possible before people show symptoms. there have been reports of this occurring with covid-19, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."
where can i find more advice on assessing and managing health risks around international mass gatherings?,"who has produced guidance and also a training course on how to plan for a mass gathering. the guidance and the course both look at how to conduct a risk assessment, plan for and manage health risks in partnership with the local authorities: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings  you can find advice to give individual participants on how to protect themselves and their loved ones from covid-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
"can i play games at home, such as minecraft?",definitely! playing video games is a great relaxing activity when you're vacationing at home. games with multiplayer modes are also a good way to socialize with friends when you can't visit them in person.
how much is the peuc weekly benefit amount?,your peuc weekly benefit amount is the same as your regular uc weekly benefit rate. your weekly benefit rate is based on your reported earnings during the base year (the first four of the last five completed quarters). you must also have over 18 credit weeks (weeks during which you earned $116 or more) in your base year to be eligible for uc.click here to find out how to calculate your weekly benefit rate.
"i already completed a social distancing protocol under a prior health officer order. do i need to complete a
        new one?","yes. all businesses operating in any way in the county, including businesses that completed a social distancing
    protocol under a prior order, must complete and implement a new one using the most recent (july 2) version and
    submit it at www.covid19prepared.org using the
    county’s online form. the new social distancing protocol must be completed and submitted before the new order goes
    into effect."
"i would like to know when the showers are going to open, because people who travel by bike would like to freshen up before work.",whether shower facilities are or will be available at your work location will be dependent upon local conditions/restrictions. please engage with your local chain of command or supervisor for information relevant to your region.
find ways to do therapeutic tasks at home to build skills.,"visits with therapists are no longer possible, but you may be able to find ways for your loved one to practice skills from therapy. look for fun ways to work on essential skills. 


fine motor: drawing, writing in a journal, beads, arts and crafts

independence: laundry, cooking together, cleaning

speech: reading books out loud, family games"
how is penn medicine prioritizing which types of patients should have surgery?,"we are prioritizing patients for surgery based on their medical condition, their risk for disease progression, their decision to have surgery or procedure, and available resources."
what should i do if i’m at higher risk for getting sick from covd-19?,"if you are at higher risk for serious illness from covid-19 because of your age or because you have a serious long-term health problem, it is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease. limit your interaction with other people as much as possible. take precautions to prevent getting covid-19 when you do interact with others. visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html.
you should:

have drugs and supplies on hand

call your military or civilian health care team to ask if you need extra prescription drugs in case there is a covid-19 outbreak in your area and you need to stay home for longer than your prescriptions will last.
 for more information.) you may be able to have an authorized person pick up your drugs from the military or retail pharmacy or get them delivered to your home – call your pharmacy for information. if you are sick and should stay home, think about using the tricare mail-order pharmacy program. (certain rules may apply that you’ll need to follow.  see tricare.mil/pharmacy
be sure you have over-the-counter medicines and supplies (tissues, fever-reducing drugs, etc.) on hand to treat fever and other symptoms.
have enough household items and groceries on hand so that you can stay at home for a long period of time – as determined your care provider and local guidance


take everyday safety measures:
    
avoid contact with people who are sick.  stay home as much as possible
wash your hands often - with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.  wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing, or being in a public place.
if soap and water aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol.
avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated spaces.  don’t shake hands or hug others.   your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like covid-19 is higher in crowded, closed-in settings with little air flow if there are people in the crowd who are sick.  use extra caution if you have to go out in public. 
        
limit your touching of frequently touched surfaces: elevator buttons, door handles, hand rails.
use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if you must touch something.
wash or sanitize your hands after touching often-touched public surfaces


avoid touching your face, nose, and eyes, much as possible.
clean and disinfect your home to remove germs: clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks & cell phones).
if covid-19 is spreading in your community, take extra steps to distance yourself from other people.  think about ways of getting food to your home, for example, have family, or social and commercial services drop them off."
i don't have a lawyer to help me with my housing court case. how can i  get help?,"for  now, no housing court cases can proceed if the tenant does not have a lawyer.
hra's office of civil justice will work with  city-funded legal services providers and the courts to assign attorneys to  unrepresented tenants who go to court because they have received a warrant of  eviction. 
if you need rental assistance, you can also apply  for help from hra. in most cases, the entire process can be done without going  in person to the hra office. visit access hra to submit your applications for emergency rental assistance and other benefits. 
for  more information, you can call 311 and ask for the tenant helpline to learn about the latest updates  and get connected with legal help."
stream a worship service on your computer or smart device.,"although it's not safe to congregate in churches right now, there are still options that will allow you to attend a live service right from your home. check with your home church to see if they'll be live-streaming their easter morning service. if they're not, or if you don't have a home church, try searching social media to find a church whose beliefs are similar to yours, then stream their service. 
you may also be able to find services from nearby churches being broadcast on your local stations. check your programming so you know when to tune in, or set it up to record and watch it on your own time."
what should be the criteria for excluding an athlete or other accredited participant from competing?,"agreed health criteria are needed for the exclusion of athletes from competing and for allowing them to return to competition wherever appropriate. these should be consistent with public health guidelines for the general population, with risk profiles based on recent travel to high-risk community transmission zones, recent contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having covid-19, current symptomatology, etc. athletes who are feeling unwell should not participate in events.if testing of athletes has been agreed with the local public health service there is a need to consider test availability, time taken for receipt of test results and host-country health services capacity. criteria for exclusion of officials/judges from competition and for allowing them to return to competition where appropriate should follow guidance and criteria for the workplace.requirements for the attendance of all athletes and other accredited participants should be put in place:–   health check: travel declaration and temperature screening–   contact tracing protocols ready (with all details of those present) –   allowing extra spacing (physical distancing)–   following all hygiene precautions.  isolation procedures for athletes and other accredited participants (e.g. field-of-play staff, medical teams, officials who have close contact with the athletes) who feel unwell or become symptomatic should be clear and documented and rehearsed prior to holding the event, especially for higher risk sports, e.g. contact sports."
when is a person infectious?,"the infectious period may begin one to two days before symptoms appear, but people are likely most infectious during the symptomatic period, even if symptoms are mild and very non-specific. the infectious period is now estimated to last for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to two weeks on average in severe cases."
is this virus really more dangerous for older people / the elderly / seniors? why?,"one of the main reasons that this virus (as well as many others) is especially dangerous to older individuals is that our immune system becomes less effective as we age. this process is called immunosenescence, and it basically means that older people are more susceptible to anything that the immune system would normally defend against - including infections, as well as cancer. unfortunately, this still applies even to older people who are otherwise in good health.
so, while a healthy senior is probably not in as much danger as another elderly person who is also, for example, diabetic, or has a heart problem, you are still in more danger than you would have been at age 35 or 45.
we can see this by looking at the rate of death by age group in covid-19 patients in the us. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, as of march 16, a total of 4226 cases of covid-19 had been documented in the united states. of these cases, fatality was highest in persons aged ≥85, ranging from 10% to 27%, followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65–84 years, 1% to 3% among persons aged 55-64 years, <1% among persons aged 20–54 years, and no fatalities among persons aged ≤19 years.

what information is available to help my business develop an organizational contingency plan?,we have posted available print resources and highlights on the vdh website.
"i heard there have been dogs and cats, and even a tiger, that have tested positive. is my pet at risk?","a very small number of pets, including dogs and cats,  have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes covid-19 after close contact with people with covid-19. there have been no reports of pets becoming sick with covid-19 in the united states. to date, there is no evidence that pets can spread the virus to people.
the first case of an animal testing positive for covid-19 in the united states was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in new york city. samples from this tiger were taken and tested after several lions and tigers at the zoo showed signs of respiratory illness. public health officials believe these large cats became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was actively shedding virus."
what do the local lockdown restrictions mean?,"so that more people can lead lives closer to normal, the government is replacing national restrictions with local action to contain local outbreaks. where increased local transmission of covid-19 is identified, areas may be required to take additional measures to reduce the spread of the virus. this could include closing certain premises or restricting the movements of people and interactions with others."
chat daily with your new connections to slowly build a connection.,"you likely have some extra time on your hands, so use it to get to know people. message or text your new friends or potential partners throughout the day so you can build a relationship. ask them questions, tell them factoids about yourself, and send funny memes. 

if you’re trying to date someone, get into the habit of sending them “good morning” and “good night” texts. additionally, tell them what you’re doing at different times of the day so they can get a feel for who you are.
if you’re making friends, text the person funny stories, ask them questions, or exchange silly memes. you could also talk about a shared interest."
will this be done in the form of an agency rule(s) or guidance? by when?,"if necessary, usda will issue an order to a company or an establishment requiring them to fulfill their contracts. rulemaking is not necessary for usda to carry out the delegated authorities under the defense production act."
how safe are public restrooms?,"“if you don’t have to use the public restroom, don’t,” said microbiologist ali nouri, president of the federation of american scientists. but he acknowledged that’s not always possible: “sometimes when you gotta go, you gotta go.”
close contact with others is the most significant risk in a public restroom, nouri said. so if there’s a single-person bathroom available that doesn’t have multiple stalls, using that might be best. 
if you do use a multi-stall public restroom, nouri offers the following tips: 

use paper towels to dry your hands, not the hand dryer. air dryers can spread viral particles around the room. and paper towels have been shown to remove residual viral particles more effectively than air.
don’t use your freshly washed hands to turn off the water with the germ-laden faucet handle. instead, use a paper towel to turn off the water and open the bathroom door. throw away the paper towel immediately afterward.
wear a face mask. “masks are one of the most effective ways to stop human-to-human transmission,” nouri said. “if people in a public bathroom are not wearing masks, think twice before going in.” 
if the restroom looks crowded, wait until it clears out, if you can.  “you’re reducing the risk of inhaling aerosolized particles from other people,” nouri said."
what is the definition of a “contact” of covid-19?,"close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of a person with covid-19 for at least 15 minutes or having exposure to the person’s respiratory secretions (for example, coughed or sneezed on; shared a drinking glass or utensils; kissing) while they were contagious. a person with covid-19 is considered to be contagious starting from 2 days before they became sick, or 2 days before they tested positive if they never had symptoms. contacts of covid-19 must quarantine, which means stay at home to limit community exposure to illness and to see if symptoms develop.  for details see faq section isolation / quarantine / movement restrictions / public health monitoring."
what can parents do before school starts to keep their child with food allergies safe at school?,"make sure that you provide the school with health care provider documentation (hcp) of the child’s food allergy and treatment protocols. this includes hcp authorization and parental consent to administer medication to students in the event of anaphylaxis or illness due to exposure. meet with school staff, including teachers, school nurses and administrators, to discuss safety measures and establishing/updating a section 504 plan."
can you get coronavirus by touching a dead body or the ashes of someone who had covid-19?,"it appears unlikely, but the cdc advises taking precautions.
experts believe coronavirus is mainly spread during close contact (about 6 feet) with a person who is currently infected, the cdc said.
“this type of spread is not a concern after death,” the cdc said. but it cautions that “we are still learning how it spreads.”
“there may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing,” the cdc said. 
“other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.”
if washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, “families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible,” the cdc said.
“at a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. if splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (ppe) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and n-95 respirator).”
cremated remains can be considered sterile, as infectious agents do not survive incineration-range temperatures, the cdc said."
are national parks in georgia open?,"following guidance from the white house, centers for disease control and prevention, and state and local public health authorities, the national parks system (nps) is increasing access and services in a phased approach across all units of the national park system. for a list of national parks in georgia, visit the nps website. before visiting a park, please check the park website to determine its operating status. for updates on the nps response to covid-19, including safety information, visit the nps coronavirus website."
discard your mask if it’s torn or dirty.,"before you put on a surgical mask, check to see if it’s torn or dirty in any spots. if it is, throw your mask away and replace it with a new one."
"if i'm an ems worker or first responder, how can i protect myself from getting covid-19?","persons needing 911 services or transportation to the hospital have been told to let ems and other first responders know they have covid-19 symptoms and to wear a mask. if they do not have a face mask, give them one as soon as possible.
ems workers and first responders can protect themselves by wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment and practicing good hand hygiene. be sure that your rig is cleaned after transporting a suspect covid-19 person or person with respiratory symptoms.
note: many testing sites across the state have made exceptions to test first responders with valid credentials. you can find more information about these sites including their locations, hours, and testing requirements here.
in addition, first responders and health care workers, both career and volunteer, can access appointment-only, drive thru testing sites in the meadowlands, deptford, and somerset. these sites have been opened by the new jersey state policemen's benevolent association, in partnership with accurate diagnostic labs: njpba.adlabscovidtest.com

what is an immunity passport or a risk-free certificate and what is who’s view of this?,"some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, could serve as the basis for an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate” that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection. at this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate.” that is, there is currently no evidence to determine whether or not people who have recovered from covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.who view on the use of an ""immunity passports"" in the context of covid-19 is available here: https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19"
look for the same information in multiple news sources.,"search a claim or “fact” that you come across online in a search engine to see if other credible sources are also reporting similar information.  if you only see one source making a claim, it’s a sign that it could be false.
type in the claim in a search engine like google or bing to see if other sources are reporting something similar."
limit your intake of alcohol.,"if you’re old enough to legally drink, it’s okay to enjoy a serving of wine, beer, or liquor if your doctor says it’s okay. however, it’s important that you not drink to cope with your feelings, as this will make things worse. monitor your drinking so it doesn’t become excessive. 
it’s best to talk to your doctor about how much is safe for you to drink. in general, all women and men over the age of 65 should limit themselves to 1 drink per day, while men under the age of 65 can drink up to 2 drinks."
where can i find mask guidance?,guidance for wearing masks.
what can i do to help?,"everyone can do their part to help us respond to the covid-19 outbreak:

we should all do our part to protect people in our community from being harassed or discriminated against as a result of bigotry. covid-19 is not tied to one racial or ethnic group.

get a flu shot if you are able to, help stop the spread of germs, and take flu antivirals if prescribed. keeping people out of the doctor’s office for the flu will allow our health care providers to serve the growing number of people coming in to get tested for covid-19.
people who have fully recovered from covid-19 have antibodies in their plasma that attack the virus.  learn about plasma donations from recovered covid-19 patients."
i’d like to help by donating face coverings in my community. how can i do that?,contact your local health jurisdiction to find out what the need is locally and what organizations may be accepting donations for community distribution.
can cycle threshold (ct) values be used to assess when a person is no longer infectious?,"no. although attempts to culture virus from upper respiratory specimens have been largely unsuccessful when ct values are in high but detectable ranges, ct values are not a quantitative measure of viral burden. in addition, ct values are not standardized by rt-pcr platform nor have they been approved by fda for use in clinical management. cdc does not endorse or recommend use of ct values to assess when a person is no longer infectious. however, serial ct values may be useful in the context of the entire body of information available when assessing recovery and resolution of infection."
what should i do if my child is sick?,"children will still get bellyaches,
               ear infections, anxiety,
               and other health problems. doctors are open for business and ready to help make kids
               feel better. call your doctor's office to ask what to do. they will tell you whether
               you need an in-person visit or if telehealth is an option. they also can tell you
               what to do if your child needs care right away and they're not available."
does who recommend the use of fabric masks for the general public?,"at the present time, the widespread use of masks everywhere is not supported by high-quality scientific evidence, and there are potential benefits and harms to consider.however, there are some settings in which it may not be possible to keep physical distancing and the use of a mask could be helpful to provide a barrier to limit the spread of potentially infectious droplets from someone who is infected. in addition, there is some evidence which suggests that some infected people without showing symptoms may be able to transmit the virus others.for this reason, who advises that governments should encourage the use of non-medical fabric masks, which can act as a barrier to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others where there are many cases of covid-19, for people in the general public where physical distancing of at least 1 metre is not possible – such as, on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.it is important to note that masks should only be used as part of a comprehensive strategy. masks on their own will not protect you from covid-19. people should also clean their hands frequently and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others."

"what is the protocol for staff members returning to work after visiting covid-19     affected countries (i.e., those with ongoing transmission)?","if you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for     14 days after travel.   during that period, you should immediately seek medical attention should you develop any     signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough.   remember to share your previous travel history with your health care provider and make     every effort to inform them by phone prior to visiting a medical facility and wear a medical     mask when you seek medical care.   you should only return to work when you are well and completely free of symptoms.   hr personnel and managers are encouraged to exercise flexibility around remote working to     support staff."
stay on top of other bills and work with your service providers as necessary.,"if you've lost income on top of the threat of a pandemic, take a breath and center yourself. make a list of your monthly bills and their due dates. then, contact the service providers for bills you don't think you'll be able to pay and explain your situation. 

check with your auto insurance company to see if they're providing any discounts or credits for policyholders. 

most service providers have plans in place to assist people who have been severely impacted by the outbreak. however, you have to first let them know if you're one of those people who could use some help."

visit your local election website for vote by mail application deadlines.,"in most states, you’ll need to apply by a certain deadline in order to vote by mail. go to your state or local election website to find out when that is.  try to do this as early as possible so that you don’t miss your opportunity to send in a ballot!

you can find a list of application deadlines by state at vote.org: https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/.
the amount of time you have to request (and send) your absentee ballot differs from one state to another. for example, in california, you can hand in your application for an absentee ballot in person on election day. in nevada, though, you have to deliver your application, or it must be received by mail, at least 14 days in advance. 

if you sent in your application by the state deadline but your absentee ballot doesn’t arrive on time, don’t worry! you might still be able to vote by mail using a federal write-in absentee ballot.  you can download the fwab here: https://www.fvap.gov/eo/overview/materials/forms."
i have developed a serology test kit for sars-cov-2 antibodies. is there an opportunity to have my serology test independently validated? can i use this for an eua request? (updated 5/4),"all clinical tests should be validated prior to use. tests, including serology tests, being offered prior to or without an eua under a policy outlined in the policy for coronavirus disease-2019 tests, have not been reviewed or authorized by the fda. as stated in the guidance, all such tests should be validated by the developer prior to being offered for clinical use. the fda has provided regulatory flexibility regarding the timing of the independent check by the fda for certain tests used during the public health emergency, but still expects all developers to validate their tests prior to offering them for limited clinical uses.
the fda is working with the national institutes of health (nih), the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and the biomedical advanced research and development authority (barda) to assess the performance of serological tests for detection of sars-cov-2 antibodies. this project is intended to complement and inform fda review as needed. as part of this project, the fda, working with partnering agencies, has designed a performance assessment protocol that offers a mechanism for an independent evaluation of lateral flow and certain enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) sars-cov-2 antibody tests in a laboratory environment. under this protocol, each test submitted to the national cancer institute (nci)/nih will be evaluated with a well-characterized sample panel consisting of positive and negative plasma and/or serum samples. the nih/nci validation project is an important resource to independently validate tests that are on the market but have not come in through the eua process for fda review. performance results can be included by the test developer in an eua submission. as stated in the guidance, fda may leverage data from testing at the nci/nih, or at another federal government laboratory designated by fda, to inform decisions on eua requests and other actions.
if you are interested in participating in this validation project, please send an email to cdrh-oir-pops@fda.hhs.gov. include the following information in your email:
manufacturer and test name as provided in your notification to fda,
volume of tests currently available to distribute in the united states,
weekly production volume available to distribute in the united states,
test technology,
sample type, and
pre-eua (peua) or eua number if you have been assigned one."
will vodka or other hard alcohols work as disinfectants against the coronavirus? what about vinegar?,"vodka, or other hard alcohols, are not recommended for disinfecting surfaces. furthermore, there is no evidence that vinegar is effective against coronavirus. it would be best to use diluted bleach solutions (1/3 cup for every gallon of water), alcohol-based cleaners with 70% alcohol, or most epa-registered disinfectants. surfaces should also be cleaned prior to disinfecting them. (if they are visibly dirty, the disinfectant will be less effective.) the cdc has guidance on how best to clean surfaces.

try to avoid talking about the virus all the time with coworkers.,"while the virus is probably on everyone’s mind, focusing on it all the time makes everyone’s anxiety worse. try to engage in normal conversation as much as you can to get everyone’s mind on other things. ask about family, hobbies, tv shows, and other non-virus topics. 
with social distancing guidelines, many people are catching up on the latest tv and movies. try asking everyone what they’re watching now for a good conversation idea."
schedule each day so you can stick to a routine.,"plan out your day as though you were still staying in a dorm or on-campus housing. set your alarm for your classes as you usually would, and perform your usual morning routine, like showering and getting dressed. even if you’re not going to a physical class, you can still keep a steady, consistent schedule for yourself. 

for instance, if your first class is at 10:00 am, you can set your alarm for 9:00 am so you have plenty of time to wake up and get ready.
if you’re still following a schedule, your mind will still feel like it’s in the college routine."
