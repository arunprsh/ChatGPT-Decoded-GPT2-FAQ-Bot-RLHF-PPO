social distancing & business operations during the covid-19 pandemic,"q. do you have best practices to share with retail food stores, restaurants, and food pick-up and delivery services that cover safe food handling, as well as employee health? - added april 16, 2020
fda is sharing information about best practices to operate retail food stores, restaurants, and associated pick-up and delivery services during the covid-19 pandemic to safeguard workers and consumers. the information in two convenient formats addresses key considerations for how foods offered at retail and restaurants can be safely handled and delivered to the public, as well as key best practices for employee health, cleaning and sanitizing, and personal protective equipment (ppe). see best practices for retail food stores, restaurants, and food pick-up/delivery services during the covid-19 pandemic.
q: how do i maintain social distancing in my animal food production/processing facility and food retail establishment where employees typically work within close distances? - updated 4/6/2020
to prevent spread of covid-19, cdc is recommending individuals employ social distancing or maintaining approximately 6 feet from others, when possible. in animal food production/processing facilities and retail food establishments, an evaluation should be made to identify and implement operational changes that increase employee separation. however, social distancing to the full 6 feet will not be possible in some animal food facilities.
the risk of an employee transmitting covid-19 to another is dependent on distance between employees, the duration of the exposure, and the effectiveness of employee hygiene practices and sanitation. when it’s impractical for employees in these settings to maintain social distancing, effective hygiene practices should be maintained to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. also, see should employees in animal food production and retail settings and delivery staff for home-based delivery services wear face coverings to prevent exposure to covid-19?
important: maintaining social distancing in the absence of effective hygiene practices may not prevent the spread of this virus. animal food facilities should be vigilant in their hygiene practices, including frequent and proper hand-washing and routine cleaning of surfaces that workers commonly touch or contact. 
because the intensity of the covid-19 outbreak may differ according to geographic location, coordination with state and local officials is strongly encouraged for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.  
sick employees should follow the cdc’s what to do if you are sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).
q: should employees, such as cashiers, baggers, and cleaning personnel in animal food production and retail settings (such as pet stores or farm supply stores) and delivery staff for home-based delivery services, wear face coverings to prevent exposure to covid-19? - updated 4/24/2020
on april 3, the cdc released an updated recommendation regarding the use of cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of covid-19.  cdc recommends the use of simple cloth face coverings as a voluntary public health measure in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). 
for workers on farms, and in food production, processing, and retail settings who do not typically wear masks as part of their jobs, consider the following if you choose to use a cloth face covering to slow the spread of covid-19:
maintain face coverings in accordance with parameters in fda’s model food code sections 4-801.11 clean linens and 4-802.11 specifications.
launder reusable face coverings before each daily use.
cdc also has additional information on the use of face coverings, including washing instructions and information on how to make homemade face covers.
note:  the cloth face coverings recommended by cdc are not surgical masks or n-95 respirators.  those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current cdc guidance.
in addition, fda has developed a fact sheet to provide helpful information to the human and animal food industries on the use of respirators, facemasks, and cloth face coverings in the food and agriculture sector during coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic (last updated 4/24/20).
q: what steps can i take to clean my animal food facility/equipment to prevent the spread of covid-19?
some steps that can be taken to clean a facility or equipment to prevent the spread of covid-19 include:
following current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) requirements for animal food safety to maintain clean surfaces.
while not universally required under the cgmps in the preventive controls for animal food (pcaf) regulation, consider sanitizing high-contact surfaces and equipment that workers may come into contact with.
see:  fsma final rule for preventive controls for animal food.
human food facilities are required to use epa-registered “sanitizer” products in their cleaning and sanitizing practices. cleaning and sanitizing agents used in animal food production must be safe and adequate under the conditions for use.  using the epa-registered sanitizers may be one means of helping ensure safety and adequacy.
in addition, there is a list of epa-registered “disinfectant” products for covid-19 on the disinfectants for use against sars-cov-2 list that have qualified under epa’s emerging viral pathogen program for use against sars-cov-2, the coronavirus that causes covid-19. 
important: check the product label guidelines for if and where these disinfectant products are safe and recommended for use in food manufacturing areas or food establishments. 
we encourage coordination with localexternal link disclaimer health officials for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.
animal food facilities may want to consider a more frequent cleaning schedule.
q: are workers in the animal food (including for livestock and pet animals) sector considered part of the essential critical infrastructure workforce?
yes, in a guidance last updated by department of homeland security on march 28, guidance on the essential critical infrastructure workforce: ensuring community and national resilience in covid-19 response, workers in the food and agriculture sector – agricultural production, food processing, distribution, retail and food service and allied industries – are named as essential critical infrastructure workers. promoting the ability of american workers within the food and agriculture industry to continue to work during periods of community restrictions, social distances, and closure orders, among others, is crucial to community continuity and community resilience.
q: where should i send questions if we are having problems moving animal food/ingredients or getting animal food/ingredients through areas that have curfews and restrictions because of the coronavirus?
if you are experiencing issues regarding your supply chain, delivery of goods, or business continuity, please contact the fema national business emergency operations center at nbeoc@fema.dhs.gov. this is a 24/7 operation and they can assist in directing your inquiry to the proper contact. 
q: will fda/epa approve off-label use of quaternary ammonium sanitizer at 200 ppm as a hand sanitizer for checkers and customers?  it is currently on the epa approved list for use in retail to sanitize food prep areas, dishes etc., and we would like to use it instead of gel hand sanitizer due to the lack of availability.
we are aware of temporary out-of-stock conditions of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.  several manufacturers of these products have indicated that they are working to replenish supplies.  in addition, the fda has issued guidance for the temporary compounding of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers by pharmacists in state-licensed pharmacies or federal facilities and registered outsourcing facilities.  see immediately in effect guidance for industry: policy for temporary compounding of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products during the public health emergency.  fda has also issued guidance for the temporary preparation of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products by firms during the public health emergency (covid-19).  see guidance for industry: temporary policy for preparation of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products during the public health emergency (covid-19).
hand sanitizers are not intended to replace handwashing in food production and retail settings.  instead, hand sanitizers may be used in addition to or in combination with proper handwashing.  cdc recommends that everyone wash their hands with plain soap and water. alcohol-based hand sanitizers may be used if plain soap and water are not available.
as an interim measure, we understand some food establishments have set up quaternary ammonium hand-dip stations and sprays at 200 ppm concentration. these products are intended for use on surfaces, and as such, may not be formulated for use on skin. fda is aware of adverse event reports from consumers using such products as a replacement for hand sanitizers and advises against using these products as replacements for hand sanitizers.","businesses and organizations are required to comply with all public health orders, including executive order no. 152(a), which requires individuals 65 years of age or older not present in a congregate setting such as an indoor facility (such venue where there is more than one person per 6 feet) from others for 14 days prior approval by their local county government officials; however it does require that any individual over 60 be admitted into quarantine at home until they meet certain criteria before entering another location on site under this directive if he/she has had direct contact between people who have tested positive but donot live together since march 2020lient isolation facilities must remain open 24 hours apart except when providing care services via telehealth only while performing essential functions related directly through telemedicine technology provided within these entities","businesses and organizations that are experiencing a shortage of workers should consider hiring or reopening. these employees will be able to work remotely, but they may not have access for other reasons such as health care needs (e., eua), financial need related services like unemployment compensation benefits/retirement plans etc.. if you can't find an employer in your area who is willing – please contact them directly by phone at 800–843 6354  or emailing cdc@covidsystemsolutionscorpusternalislandlinelineservicesandservices/.",0.7902040481567383,0.7801167368888855

should i be tested with an antibody (serology) test for covid-19?,"these tests tell you if you had a previous infection by looking for antibodies in the blood.  antibodies are proteins made by the immune system when a germ enters a person’s body. our immune system helps us fight off germs and diseases. the test uses a blood sample to look for antibodies made in response to sars-cov-2 rather than looking for the virus itself. it usually takes 1-3 weeks for the body to make antibodies in response to an infection. we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.
antibody tests have limited ability to diagnose covid-19 and should not be used alone to diagnose covid-19. results from these tests should also not be used to make decisions about staffing or the ability of an employee to return to work, the need for available personal protective equipment (ppe), or the need to discontinue preventive measures, like social distancing.","yes, you can get a coronavirus diagnostic kit from the cdc. if your blood sample is positive and it has been in contact therewith people who have recovered or are presumed to become infected by sars cov2 virus that causes 2019 novelcoronavirus disease2019(covidsars), then testing is recommended as part of any strategy outlined above until more information becomes available about how long this protection will last after recovery; however we do not know yet whether antibodies provide lifelong immunity against other coronaviruses such like mers/cov infectionida chlorinated chicken eggs","the cdc recommends that people who have been exposed to a person suspected of having or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, including those in close contact and others living near persons infected by this virus. if you are not sure whether your exposure is related but do know someone has had symptoms consistent at least 6 months after their initial infection date then please consult local health officials before testing yourself as well because it may help them determine which individuals might develop new cases during these early stages when they first become sick from illness rather than later on due more severe illnesses such pneumonia/sars2a).",0.8358967304229736,0.8188048005104065
help! i’m frustrated with my partner.,"that makes sense. if you’re cohabitating, you could be in a tough spot. if you’re not, you’ve probably had to figure out ways to see each other — or not — that feel safe and nurturing for you and the people around you.

no matter who you are or how you are interacting, make sure you take care of yourself first. then, make a plan. if you are both working from home, when can you take time to care for each other and feel normal and romantic again? what rituals can you implement to separate day from night, roommates from lovers? you might just have to impose boundaries. 
if you were both at work before the pandemic, separately, during the day, you probably didn’t talk for 14 waking hours straight. build in time apart, as if you really were at the office, so seeing each other is a nice break at the end of the day, rather than a droning grind.

how can we protect people seeking tuberculosis care during the covid-19 pandemic?,"in a context of widespread restriction of movement of the population in response to the pandemic and isolation of covid-19 patients, communication with the healthcare services should be maintained so that people with tuberculosis (tb), especially those most vulnerable, get essential services. this includes management of adverse drug reactions and co-morbidities, nutritional and mental health support, and restocking of the supplies of medicines. enough tb medicines will need to be dispensed to the patient or caregiver to last until the next visit. this will limit interruption or unnecessary visits to the clinic. mechanisms to deliver medicines at home and even to collect specimens for follow-up testing may become expedient. home-based tb treatment is bound to become more common. alternative arrangements to reduce clinic visits may involve limiting appointments to specific times to avoid exposure to other clinic attendees; using digital technologies to maintain treatment support. community health workers become more critical as treatment is more decentralized.more tb patients will probably start their treatment at home and therefore limiting the risk of household transmission of tb during the first few weeks is important. vulnerable populations who have poor access to healthcare should not get further marginalized during the pandemic.","tb treatment and prevention should be prioritized for those who are at high risk of complications from infection. in addition, it is important to ensure that patients with severe immunosuppression (e., cancer or organ transplant) have access not only through their own health system but also by accessing alternative means such as home delivery where possible; including via telemedicine visits when feasible if necessary due diligence measures must still take place on all individuals involved and caregivers need personal protective equipment while caring indoors/outdoor whenever needed[ 1). this includes providing hand hygiene stations throughout facilities which provide adequate supplies [ 2 ].

any close contact sport played with people who are not members of your household. close
        interactions with people from other households create too much risk of covid-19 transmission.  this means you
        can’t play close contact sports (those that involve either physical contact or physical proximity of 6 feet

you can also play any other sport or game with people from other households that doesn’t involve close
            contact (like tennis, bowling, running, or archery). 

going to a pro sporting event as a spectator. professional sports teams can train in their
        facilities, or hold games without any spectators present if the local health officer approves their
        facility-specific protocols, but you cannot attend a pro sports event as a spectator because allowing crowds at

can organized sports practices resume? can professional sports resume?,"organized sports
organized sports activities have restarted in stages.
low-risk, non-contact sports, such as golf and tennis, can resume practices and competitions, indoors and outdoors.
medium- and high-risk sports, including baseball, softball, soccer, basketball, and football can resume contact practices and competitions in outdoor settings only. non-contact practices and drills can resume in both indoor and outdoor settings.
the department of health has issued guidance for organized sports with further details on which sports are defined in which category, how to create a sports program preparation plan, how to prepare a facility for sports practices, how to conduct sports practices, and how to prepare for games and tournaments.
all sports will have to abide by a number of health and safety protocols in the guidance, including screenings for athletes, coaches, and staff, limited equipment sharing, and strong requirements for disinfecting and sanitizing equipment.
staff, parents, guardians, and visitors are required to wear cloth face coverings at practices and games. athletes are encouraged to wear masks during downtime, but not during physical activity.
all competitions or tournaments must abide by the limit on outdoor gatherings, which is currently limited to 500 people.
fall school sports season
sports under the jurisdiction of the new jersey state interscholastic athletic association (njsiaa) or the national collegiate athletic association (ncaa) must also abide by those associations' rules.
the final determination on the fall high school sports seasons will be made by the njsiaa, and school districts will make the ultimate decision on whether teams will resume competition.
a student-athlete's ability to participate with their team will not be altered in any way - regardless of whether they participate in remote-learning or in-person instruction.
note: a new law waives the requirement to complete an annual pre-participation physical examination for any student-athlete enrolled in grade six to 12 who either completed a physical examination during the 2019-2020 school year or completed a physical examination that allowed the student to participate on a school-sponsored interscholastic or intramural athletic team or squad during the 2019-2020 school year.
a student-athlete who has not completed a physical examination within 365 days prior to the first day of official practice in the athletic season is permitted to participate on a school-sponsored athletic team provided they complete the physical examination before the end of the athletic season.
professional sports
professional sports teams which train or play in new jersey can practice and engage in games or matches, if their leagues resume competition.
the state has been in constant discussions with these teams about the protocols they will have in place to protect the health and safety of the players, coaches, and team personnel - including facilities where proper sanitation and hygiene practices can be readily maintained.

what strategies can people use to cope with a disaster?,"it is natural to feel stress, anxiety, grief, and worry during and after a disaster. everyone reacts differently, and your own feelings will change over time. notice and accept how you feel. taking care of your emotional health during an emergency will help you think clearly and react to the urgent needs to protect yourself and your family. self-care during an emergency will help your long-term healing.
take the following steps to cope with a disaster:

take care of your body– try to eat healthy well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, and get plenty of sleep. avoid alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.
connect with others– share your concerns and how you are feeling with a friend or family member. maintain healthy relationships, and build a strong support system.
take breaks– make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. try taking in deep breaths. try to do activities you usually enjoy.
stay informed– when you feel that you are missing information, you may become more stressed or nervous. watch, listen to, or read the news for updates from officials. always check your sources and turn to reliable sources of information like your local government authorities.
avoid too much exposure to news– take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories. it can be upsetting to hear about the crisis and see images repeatedly. try to do enjoyable activities and return to normal life as much as possible and check for updates between breaks.
seek help when needed– if distress impacts activities of your daily life for several days or weeks, talk to a clergy member, counselor, or doctor, or contact the samhsa (substance abuse and mental health services administration) helpline at 1-800-985-5990.
for victims and survivors of abuse who need support, the national domestic violence hotline is available 24/7. call 1-800-799-7233 or 1-800-799-7233 for tty. if you are unable to speak safely, you can log onto thehotline.org or text loveis to 22522. the virginia department of social services also has a family violence and sexual assault hotline available 24/7 at 1-800-838-8238.

"questions addressing the proper handling of healthcare personnel (hcp) who have clinically recovered from sars-cov-2 infection, but are still within 3 months of onset of their prior infection.","if hcp have a high-risk exposure within 3 months of their initial infection to a patient with sars-cov-2 infection, should they be restricted from work for 14 days after the exposure?
cdc has posted guidance addressing risk assessment and work exclusion for hcp with potential exposure to sars-cov-2. due to their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable individuals, this guidance recommends conservative management of occupationally exposed hcp.
review of currently available evidence suggests that most individuals do not become re-infected within 3 months of resolution of sars-cov-2 infection. re-infection has not been definitively identified to date. several studies have documented persistent detection of virus using pcr after recovery, some even with redevelopment or new symptoms. however, people who were newly symptomatic or tested positive for sars-cov-2 after recent resolution of an acute infection did not appear to be infectious to others. testing of asymptomatic individuals during this 3-month period is complicated by the fact that some people have detectable virus from their prior infection during this period; a positive test during this period may more likely result from a prior infection rather than a new infection that poses risk for transmission. in light of this, exposed hcp could continue to work, while monitoring for development of symptoms. if symptoms develop, exposed hcp should be assessed and potentially tested for sars-cov-2, if an alternate etiology is not identified. some facilities might still choose to institute work exclusion for hcp following a high-risk exposure.
2. if hcp within 3 months of their initial infection develop symptoms consistent with covid-19, should they be excluded from work and retested?
hcp within 3 months of a confirmed sars-cov-2 infection who develop symptoms consistent with covid-19 should be evaluated to identify potential alternative etiologies for their symptoms. if an alternate etiology for the symptoms cannot be identified, they may need to be retested for sars-cov-2 infection with the understanding that a positive viral test could represent residual viral particles from the previous infection, rather than new infection. decisions about the need for and duration of work exclusion should be based upon their suspected diagnosis (e.g., influenza, sars-cov-2 infection).
3. do hcp within 3 months of their initial infection need to wear all recommended personal protective equipment (ppe) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection? for example, if there are limited respirators, should respirators be prioritized for hcp who have not been previously infected?
regardless of suspected or confirmed immunity, healthcare personnel should always wear all recommended ppe when caring for patients. in situations of ppe shortages, facilities should refer to cdc strategies for optimizing ppe supply. however, as with other infectious diseases (e.g., measles), allocation of available ppe should not be based on whether hcp have been previously infected or have evidence of immunity.
4. should hcp within 3 months of their initial infection be preferentially assigned to care for patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection?
while individuals who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection might develop some protective immunity, the duration and extent of such immunity are not known. staffing decisions should be based on usual facility practices. any hcp assigned to care for patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection, regardless of history of infection, should follow all recommended infection prevention and control practices when providing care. guidance on mitigating staff shortages is also available.","hcw with covid 19 may be considered to present as a “patient” if they had no symptoms at all during that time period and were not tested for viral rna by rtpcr or antigen tests performed on samples collected before diagnosis; however this is only recommended in settings where there has been an outbreak associated specificallywith patient care activities suchas nursing homes/nursing home facilities and long term acute medical services hospitals / ambulatory surgery centers which cannot safely provide necessary personal protective equipment while treating patients suspected infected should contact your local health department about possible exposure risk factors including age group level 2 diabetes mellitus requiring hospitalizationirap=covid19 severity scale 1–3).""if you do become sick after being exposed  until recently because someone was confirmed positive through pcr testing then it’s important we follow standard precautions when caring members returning back into work – wear ppe whenever feasible   even though these measures might put them out further than others due diligence will help prevent transmission between staff performing essential tasks can reduce potential exposures    among those working together ahcccs recommends wearing","hcrs is a national organization that provides information on how to safely handle and care for patients with covid19 in hospitals across america during this time period; however it does not provide specific guidance regarding what should be done when caring or treating sick individuals infected by coronavirus disease 2019/20 virus at home as well because there may also remain concerns about transmission among people living near one another due close contact between persons exposed together through respiratory droplets produced while they were coughing). we encourage you to read more here  before making any decisions based upon your personal circumstances such considerations include whether an individual has been diagnosed early enough into life where exposure could pose serious health risks if spread beyond 2 weeks after initial symptoms occur – especially since many cases can persist even without further medical attention being given until later stages including acute illness), which means some situations will require additional precautions like hand hygiene measures taken immediately following first symptom presentation so all staff members do everything possible throughout these times!",0.8086557984352112,0.809319019317627

however, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. despite lower risk of serious illness, children with covid-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with older adults and people of any age who may be at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19.","the risk of severe illness from covid 19 increases with age. however, it is not clear whether this increased severity in young people means that they have a higher chance for getting very sick than older adults or those who live alone (such as grandparents). children under 18 years old and anyone over 65years plus should take extra precautions to prevent spreading infection while out on public transport if possible; wear disposable gloves when handling shared items such like food/food utensils etc., avoid touching their eyesight after eating themselfseparately disposeof used tissues immediately before cleaning hands often without washing your face covering","the number of confirmed cases in this outbreak is increasing, and there has been a significant increase since early summer. the most recent data from coronavirus disease control (cdc) shows that among adults aged 15 to 19 years old who were infected with covid19 during their first week on earth or after they had traveled for 14 days prior – about 1% increased risk compared wtih age group 2–4; however these numbers do not include those younger than 18 yrs., which means older people may have higher rates as well because many others might be exposed by themselves while still young enough so it's important we keep an eye out! 

a study published recently found no evidence supporting any link between exposure before birth but rather suggested some association was observed when infants born prematurely (<1 year), followed closely behind other groups suchas preterm babies (>2 months). additionally studies suggest several factors can contribute together including maternal smoking status/age distribution within households where transmission occurs - particularly if mothers smoke regularly due either direct contact through social distancing measures like hand washing etc.)",0.825727641582489,0.8225002288818359

if thermometers can be procured:

— employers may take their employees’ temperatures on site utilizing best practices.
— employees may self-screen taking their temperature at home with business-provided thermometers or their own personal thermometer.

if thermometers cannot be procured:

— employers may ask their employees to conduct a questionnaire-based screening at the worksite utilizing the department approved screening tool or equivalent.
— employees may self-screen by conducting a questionnaire-based screening at their home utilizing the department approved screening tool or equivalent.

if utilizing self-screening, businesses must also establish a policy for employees to report their temperature or symptoms to the employer on a daily basis. this policy should include a provision that would not allow employees with symptoms to come onto the worksite.
additionally, businesses should consider paid leave policies that incentivize workers to stay home when reporting symptoms, including a temperature of 100.4 f or higher. this would alleviate the potential of employees lying to avoid losing pay, or potentially losing jobs.

but too much vitamin d can lead to a toxic buildup of calcium in your blood that can cause confusion, disorientation, heart rhythm problems, bone pain, kidney damage and painful kidney stones.","no. the relationship of high body mass index (dl) with susceptibility to infection or disease has not been definitively established, but it may be possible that higher bmi increases in people infected by sars cov2 are associated directly relatedwith increased likelihood from having an underlying medical condition such as diabetes mellitus/chronic kidney failure; however this does little more than increase vulnerability among individuals living alone due their age and other factors including obesity which might make them at greater risks if they become ill during pregnancyseparately.​the link can also apply when looking across different populations within countries where many adults have low blood pressure because most healthy children live outside europe while others suffer chronic heart conditions like coronary artery diseases – these could lead some patients into severe illness even before becoming seriously unwell enough so doctors need additional support adjusting treatment strategies based on what we know about how common certain groups respond differentlyially over time [e., older persons).

what are the types of coronavirus (covid-19) tests?,"the two main types of tests for coronavirus look for either a current infection
               or a past infection.
to check if someone is infected with coronavirus, health care providers look for
               pieces of the virus in a sample of saliva (spit)
               or mucus. these tests can tell if the person is infected on the day of the
               test.
health care providers can:

use a long swab (like a q-tip) to take a sample from inside the nose (at the start
               of the nostrils, the middle of the nose, or the very back of the nose), the throat,
               the inside of the cheeks, or along the gums or tongue.
give the person a container to spit or cough into.

people can get the test in a doctor's office or other testing sites (such as pharmacies
               or pop-up sites). some areas offer drive-thru
               testing, which lets people stay in their car during the test. at some testing
               sites, people can swab themselves following directions from the health care team.
               there also are special kits that families can order to do the test at home.
depending on the type of test and where it was done, results can be ready that
               day or take a week or longer if the test went to a lab. currently, home kits always
               go to a lab. results might take longer if a community does many tests at the same
               time.
a ""positive"" test means a person is infected with coronavirus, and a ""negative""
               test means they aren't infected. but sometimes the test results aren't accurate. a
               test result can be negative even when someone has the virus. this is why some people
               get a second test. rarely, the test may be positive in someone who doesn't have the
               virus.
inaccurate test results are more likely when someone is tested very early or very
               late in their infection. they tend to be more accurate when done a few days after
               someone was around an infected person or symptoms started.
before the test, make sure you understand the instructions. for a swab test, help
               your child stay still so the health care provider can get a good sample. the better
               the sample, the more accurate the results.
to see if someone had coronavirus in the past, health care providers look for antibodies, which the body
               makes after an infection. it can tell if someone had an infection in the past, at
               least 2–3 weeks before the test. that's how long it takes the body to make antibodies
               after infection. it can't tell if the person is infected at the time of the
               test, which is why this test isn't used to diagnose covid-19.
this is a blood test, with a sample taken either from a vein or a fingertip (called
               a ""fingerstick""). results can be ready on the same day, or up to a week later. there's
               no home kit for antibody testing yet.
health experts aren't sure whether antibodies protect a person from future coronavirus
               infections. and if they do, it's not clear for how long.","covid 19 is a new disease and there have not been any reports to date that it can be transmitted by people who don’t show symptoms. however, this virus has spread mainly from person–person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected individual coughs or sneezes – which may include saliva/nasal fluid expelled into their nose via coughing; direct contact with contaminated surfaces such as doorknobs in public places like grocery stores., pharmacies & other retail locations where you might come within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without wearing face coverings while out shoppingseparately spray down your hands frequentlywith soapy water after blowing them off in additionto using alcohol based hand sanitizer instead if possible[1 ]. these disinfectants should work against viruses including sars cov 2 but they must still kill most germs on hard surface particles [2 ], so use epa's instructions herefor more information about how effective ""hydroxychloroquine sulfate does - https//www3rxafda euashipelines@fonticidessexternal icon","cdc recommends that all healthcare providers and patients with suspected or confirmed covids be tested for symptoms consistent in their clinical presentation. these test results should include a description, diagnosis criteria to identify potential underlying causes such as viral shedding/infection from infected surfaces; an assessment if there is evidence suggestive(s), including laboratory testing positive but not showing any signs indicating infection by virus on surface specimens); information about how this diagnostic process works so it can help diagnose possible exposure during transmission between individuals who have been exposed at least 6 months apart without prior contact tracing using validated methods based upon known exposures within 2 weeks after initial symptom onset). the following additional questions will assist you determine whether your specimen has had direct contacts among people whose immune systems were compromised due either directly related viruses like sars2a1 nor influenza A3, which may cause severe illness when they infect others through respiratory secretions produced via aerosols generated while coughing together ’and other common pathogenswho do develop antibodies against certain strains associated “with high levels""of circulating human immunodeficiency Virus type 1b antibody [hiv].",0.7507067322731018,0.7546814680099487

but will not socializing with other children stunt my kid’s development?,"probably not, although it does make sense to worry.  
social interactions are an important part of development throughout childhood, and spending time with peers is typically part of that process. but try not to fret too much about what kids are missing right now. children are resilient and adaptable, and they’re not entirely cut off from other people. 
there is much to be gained from interactions with parents, siblings and even pets. time alone is valuable, too. and connection through technology, like hanging out or playing games through video chats, can fill in some of the blanks. even without peer interaction for a while, kids can still develop socially and emotionally in ways that will prepare them to pursue real-world friendships when those can resume.

what commercial manufacturers are distributing serology test kits under the policy outlined in section iv.d of the policy for coronavirus disease-2019 tests? (updated 8/28),"as stated in section iv.d of the fda's policy for coronavirus disease-2019 tests, the fda does not intend to object to a commercial manufacturer's development and distribution of serology tests to identify antibodies to sars-cov-2 for a reasonable period of time, where the test has been validated and while the manufacturer is preparing its eua request, where the manufacturer gives notification to the fda and information that helps users and patients understand the test results, such as the following, is included in the instructions for use:
this test has not been reviewed by the fda.
negative results do not preclude acute sars-cov-2 infection. if acute infection is suspected, direct testing for sars-cov-2 is necessary.
results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude acute sars-cov-2 infection.
positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-sars-cov-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus hku1, nl63, oc43, or 229e.
as noted in the guidance, the fda believes that 10 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an eua submission for such tests. unless and until an eua is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test, under clia, use of that test is limited to laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing, and at the point-of-care when covered by the laboratory's clia certificate for high-complexity testing.
this policy does not apply to at-home testing, including at-home specimen collection.
the commercial manufacturers in the list below have notified the fda that they have validated and intend to distribute a serology test as set forth in section iv.d of the policy for coronavirus disease-2019 tests. where the authorization status is ""fda authorized,"" the fda reviewed and issued an eua for the test after notification was given. where the authorization status is shown as ""not fda authorized,"" the fda has not yet reviewed the manufacturer's validation and issued an eua for the manufacturer's test, and the test is included in this list to provide transparency regarding the notification submitted to the fda. the ""setting for use"" designation of ""h"" refers to a laboratory certified under clia to perform high-complexity testing. certain developers have completed the eua process prior to offering a test for clinical use rather than notify fda under this policy. tests that have been issued an eua can be found on the eua page.
if an eua request is not submitted within a reasonable period of time, or if significant problems are identified with a test and cannot be or have not been addressed in a timely manner, fda intends to remove the manufacturer and test from this list, would expect the manufacturer to suspend distribution of the test, and may take additional actions as appropriate.
manufacturers that have notified fda that they have validated and intend to distribute serology tests as set forth in section iv.d:

ask the healthcare provider to let the hospital know you are coming and to share important information about caring for your child.

what is contact tracing?,"contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases.
contact tracing slows the spread of covid-19 by

letting people know they may have been exposed to covid-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of covid-19
helping people who may have been exposed to covid-19 get tested
asking people to self-isolate if they have covid-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with covid-19

during contact tracing, the health department staff will not ask you for

money
social security number
bank account information

is this virus really more dangerous for older people / the elderly / seniors? why?,"one of the main reasons that this virus (as well as many others) is especially dangerous to older individuals is that our immune system becomes less effective as we age. this process is called immunosenescence, and it basically means that older people are more susceptible to anything that the immune system would normally defend against - including infections, as well as cancer. unfortunately, this still applies even to older people who are otherwise in good health.
so, while a healthy senior is probably not in as much danger as another elderly person who is also, for example, diabetic, or has a heart problem, you are still in more danger than you would have been at age 35 or 45.
we can see this by looking at the rate of death by age group in covid-19 patients in the us. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, as of march 16, a total of 4226 cases of covid-19 had been documented in the united states. of these cases, fatality was highest in persons aged ≥85, ranging from 10% to 27%, followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65–84 years, 1% to 3% among persons aged 55-64 years, <1% among persons aged 20–54 years, and no fatalities among persons aged ≤19 years.

how safe are public restrooms?,"“if you don’t have to use the public restroom, don’t,” said microbiologist ali nouri, president of the federation of american scientists. but he acknowledged that’s not always possible: “sometimes when you gotta go, you gotta go.”
close contact with others is the most significant risk in a public restroom, nouri said. so if there’s a single-person bathroom available that doesn’t have multiple stalls, using that might be best. 
if you do use a multi-stall public restroom, nouri offers the following tips: 

use paper towels to dry your hands, not the hand dryer. air dryers can spread viral particles around the room. and paper towels have been shown to remove residual viral particles more effectively than air.
don’t use your freshly washed hands to turn off the water with the germ-laden faucet handle. instead, use a paper towel to turn off the water and open the bathroom door. throw away the paper towel immediately afterward.
wear a face mask. “masks are one of the most effective ways to stop human-to-human transmission,” nouri said. “if people in a public bathroom are not wearing masks, think twice before going in.” 
if the restroom looks crowded, wait until it clears out, if you can.  “you’re reducing the risk of inhaling aerosolized particles from other people,” nouri said.","the cdc recommends that people who live in a community with an active covid-19 outbreak avoid areas where large numbers of individuals gather, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. this includes places like homeless shelters or jails; however it is important to note there may be situations when you can’t maintain social distancing (e., if possible).  ""if someone has been diagnosed by testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019(covid‑10), they should stay home until their symptoms improve so long afterwards – even though your test results will come back negative once again within 24 hours after exposure - but only go out at least 10 minutes before going outside during these times! some communities have instituted similar measures while others require residents notto leave any area except those experiencing homelessness because doing otherwise would put them more susceptible than other populations including healthcare workers/residentsiexternal iconwho need accessor essential services due diligence on entry into facilities must wear face coverings unless leaving one place does absolutely no work from 6 feet awayexternal link","the state of emergency declared by governor murphy on march 31, 2020 has been lifted. restroom facilities in all 50 states have reopened and will reopen for business as usual to allow people with disabilities access safely while maintaining social distancing from others who may be at risk or unable due their health condition (e., covid-19). however there is still a lot more work that needs done before we can fully implement this new policy – including implementing signage requirements across our entire healthcare system so everyone knows where they're going when it comes time you need them most!",0.8051558136940002,0.7972899675369263

can you get coronavirus by touching a dead body or the ashes of someone who had covid-19?,"it appears unlikely, but the cdc advises taking precautions.
experts believe coronavirus is mainly spread during close contact (about 6 feet) with a person who is currently infected, the cdc said.
“this type of spread is not a concern after death,” the cdc said. but it cautions that “we are still learning how it spreads.”
“there may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing,” the cdc said. 
“other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.”
if washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, “families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible,” the cdc said.
“at a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. if splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (ppe) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and n-95 respirator).”
